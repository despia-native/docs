# Users are logged out when they reopen the app

**Symptom.** A user signs in, closes the app, reopens it and lands on `/auth` or `/login` again.

**Cause.** The session is stored where the app cannot read it back at launch: cookies set for the
wrong domain (or for `localhost`, which the Despia local server does not support), storage the
system cleared, a session that is only validated server side while the app is offline, or a login
page that never checks for an existing session and redirects.

**Fix.** On the login route, read the stored session first and redirect a signed-in user into the
app; store the token where the native app keeps it across launches, and validate it before
treating the user as signed out.
