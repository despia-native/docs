# OTA updates never reach the app

**Symptom.** Production deploys show up in a browser, but the installed Despia app keeps loading
the old version after closing and reopening. Some devices update and others do not. A watermark
that is still visible after moving to a commercial licence is the same symptom.

**Cause.** A service worker or PWA build plugin (`vite-plugin-pwa`, `next-pwa`,
`@angular/service-worker`, `workbox-webpack-plugin`, `@vue/cli-plugin-pwa`) caches the app and
answers every request from that cache, so the native container never fetches the new build.

**Fix.** Remove the PWA plugin and unregister the service worker (or configure it to never cache
the app shell), then rebuild and reinstall the app once.
