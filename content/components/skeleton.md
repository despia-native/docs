# skeleton

The global Web twin renders a size/radius-aware loading placeholder hidden from assistive technology.

<RefMeta platforms="Web,iOS,Android,Desktop">
Category: Display - Live specimens: the [System gallery](/system).
</RefMeta>

## Usage

```dsx
<skeleton style="height: 14px; border-radius: 8px"/>
```

`skeleton` takes no children.

## Catalog specimen

`SkeletonDefault.dsx`, verbatim from the catalog:

```dsx
<vstack style="gap: 8px; width: 100%">
  <head/>
  <skeleton style="height: 14px; border-radius: 8px"/>
  <skeleton style="height: 14px; border-radius: 8px; width: 60%"/>
</vstack>
```

Every component in the library is authored at four rungs in the catalog (default, system words, one property override, fully custom), so the cost of leaving the system design is visible in one place. The [System gallery](/system) runs them.

## States

| Renderer | Audited | Dated | Evidence |
|---|---|---|---|
| web | n/a | 2026-08-18 | Non-interactive display/layout surface: no rest/hover/pressed/focus/disabled axis (value-driven rendering is data, not interaction state; Skeleton IS the loading state). |
| ios | n/a | 2026-08-18 | Non-interactive display/layout surface: no rest/hover/pressed/focus/disabled axis (value-driven rendering is data, not interaction state; Skeleton IS the loading state). |
| android | n/a | 2026-08-18 | Non-interactive display/layout surface: no rest/hover/pressed/focus/disabled axis (value-driven rendering is data, not interaction state; Skeleton IS the loading state). |
| desktop | unaudited | unaudited | none recorded |

Rest, hover on a fine pointer, pressed, focus visible and disabled, in both colour schemes, plus loading, error and empty where the component has them.

## Attributes

`skeleton` declares no attributes of its own. Every element carries the [universal attributes](/components/attributes).

## Events

`skeleton` raises no events.

## Platform notes

| Renderer | Grammar | What that means |
|---|---|---|
| web | `supported` | the built in renderer implements this element |
| ios | `reference` | the reference renderer this element is specified against |
| android | `enforced` | implemented and pinned by the element parity test |
| desktop | `captured` | the desktop capture plane composed and measured this element at both locked widths |

The global Web twin renders a size/radius-aware loading placeholder hidden from assistive technology.

**Known limits on the web**

- Shimmer is disabled by the shared reduced-motion rules.

**Implementation notes.** Always hidden from assistive tech (Skeleton.swift:45).

Declared platforms: `ios`, `android`, `web`.

**Adaptivity (web, 2026-08-18).** identical fluid presentation at both widths (data family page 390+1366, overflow 0); RTL page mirrors (ChatBubble sides flip: firstFromRight=0) - w8 Chromium probe (compileComponent->bootDsx, full skin), scratchpad/w8/*.mjs, shots/w8-audit-*

## Theming

DSX has one styling vocabulary and it is CSS. Three doors reach this element, and they differ only in how often the look repeats: `style="..."` for a declaration list on one element, `class="..."` for a name declared in a `<style>` block, and the component's own sheet for everything a whole screen shares.

On the web this element's root carries `dsx-skeleton`, the stable class the contract application CSS targets. It is a rendering fact you can read, not a styling hook to depend on: style the element, not the class the renderer stamps.

Web runtime: `global`.

## Accessibility

| Renderer | Audited | Dated | Evidence |
|---|---|---|---|
| web | yes | 2026-08-18 | decorative loading block, no spurious semantics; axe 0 serious/critical on the data family page light (dark: text link finding filed separately) |
| ios | review | 2026-08-18 | Decorative by definition: always accessibilityHidden(true) with the documented guidance to announce loading on the container (ClosedSource/DSX/Modules/Mandatory/Foundation/Components/Core/swift/Skeleton.swift). Verified-by-review; the visual capture awaits the iOS capture lane. |
| android | review | 2026-08-18 | VERIFIED-BY-REVIEW: decorative loading placeholder: draws with no text/roles, invisible to TalkBack by construction (Displays.kt SkeletonElement - a Box+Canvas with no semantics), matching the decorative contract. |
| desktop | unaudited | unaudited | none recorded |

Every element carries `aria-label`, `aria-description`, `aria-valuetext`, `role`, `aria-pressed` and `aria-hidden`. A control that draws an icon beside text is one group with one label, never two announcements; see the [universal attributes](/components/attributes).

This page is GENERATED by ClosedSource/scripts/generate_component_docs.rb. A hand edit here is overwritten on the next run by design: fix the ledger instead (the attribute and event contract in `OpenSource/Documentation/reference/stack-elements.json`, the platform support and the audit in `OpenSource/Conformance/library/matrix.json`, the description and the web limits in `OpenSource/Engine/TypeScript/support/element-support.json`, the specimen in `OpenSource/Catalog`).
