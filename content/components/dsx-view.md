# dsx-view

The rich Web twin mounts the screen component src names from this build's compiled registry (the web reading of the native rule that a shipped tag of the same name always wins), with reactive src re-resolution, the stable dsx-view lifecycle events, and a labelled unavailable state.

## Usage

```dsx
<dsx-view src="Screens/Home.dsx"/>
```

`dsx-view` takes no children.

## Catalog specimen

The catalog has no specimen for `dsx-view` at the default rung yet, so there is nothing to copy here. It appears with no change to this page the moment the catalog carries one: the page is a projection of the catalog, not a screenshot of it.

## States

| Renderer | Audited | Dated | Evidence |
|---|---|---|---|
| web | n/a | 2026-08-18 | Non-interactive host embed: no rest/hover/pressed/focus/disabled axis on the host itself; the registry-resolution outcome (dsx-view-unavailable card) is value-driven data, and the mounted screen component's interaction states are audited on that component's own rows (OpenSource/Engine/TypeScript/support/element-support.json DSXView row; packages/dom/src/elements.ts dsx-view factory). |
| ios | review | 2026-08-18 | Screen lifecycle is the state surface: loading/ready/failed/disappear broadcast on the stable dsx-view scheme, offline-first cached render + background revalidate, atomic content generations (never mixed deploys) (ClosedSource/DSX/Modules/Mandatory/Foundation/Components/Views/DSXView/swift/DSXView.swift header LIFECYCLE + DSXRemoteCache.swift). Verified-by-review; the visual capture awaits the iOS capture lane. |
| android | review | 2026-08-18 | VERIFIED-BY-REVIEW: loading/ready/failed lifecycle broadcast on the stable surface (DSXViewComponent.kt header E1); loading placeholder = the kernel spinner (header: iOS ProgressView twin); failure strings surfaced (e.g. INTEGRITY message, DSXViewComponent.kt:134); offline-first cached render (DSXContent.cachedFile/freshFile). |
| desktop | unaudited | unaudited | none recorded |

Rest, hover on a fine pointer, pressed, focus visible and disabled, in both colour schemes, plus loading, error and empty where the component has them.

## Attributes

| Attribute | Type | Default | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|
| `origin` | `string` |  |  |
| `src` | `url` |  |  |

Every element also carries the [universal attributes](/components/attributes): accessibility, animation, `class`, `style` and the platform suffixes.

## Events

`dsx-view` raises no events.

## Platform notes

| Renderer | Grammar | What that means |
|---|---|---|
| web | `partial` | a renderer exists and is narrower than the reference in the ways listed below |
| ios | `reference` | the reference renderer this element is specified against |
| android | `module-facet` | filled by the module facet when that module is registered |
| desktop | `uncaptured` | no desktop capture has measured it, which claims nothing in either direction |

The rich Web twin mounts the screen component src names from this build's compiled registry (the web reading of the native rule that a shipped tag of the same name always wins), with reactive src re-resolution, the stable dsx-view lifecycle events, and a labelled unavailable state.

**Known limits on the web**

- src resolves against the compiled component registry only: remote DSX fetching, screen-folder manifests, and the native DSXRemoteCache/offline generation policy are native-only, so origin is not consumed.
- An unresolvable src renders the labelled dsx-view-unavailable status card instead of the native retryable DSXNativeUnavailable screen.

**Fallback.** Mounts the dsx-view host and resolves src from the compiled registry; a src this build does not ship renders a labelled role=status unavailable card, never blank and never a fake native surface.

**Implementation notes.** Remote/native DSX surface (remote-cached via DSXRemoteCache).

Declared platforms: `ios`, `android`, `web`.

**Adaptivity (web, 2026-08-18).** Pure fill-its-container embed host: the host declares no phone/tablet/desktop variance of its own; presentation belongs to the mounted screen component, audited on its own rows (OpenSource/Engine/TypeScript/support/element-support.json DSXView row).

## Theming

DSX has one styling vocabulary and it is CSS. Three doors reach this element, and they differ only in how often the look repeats: `style="..."` for a declaration list on one element, `class="..."` for a name declared in a `<style>` block, and the component's own sheet for everything a whole screen shares.

On the web this element's root carries `dsx-view`, the stable class the contract application CSS targets. It is a rendering fact you can read, not a styling hook to depend on: style the element, not the class the renderer stamps.

Web runtime: `rich`.

## Accessibility

| Renderer | Audited | Dated | Evidence |
|---|---|---|---|
| web | no, and named | 2026-08-18 | W11 disposition (b), dated decision: the web twin is the documented registry-resolved fallback (OpenSource/Engine/TypeScript/support/element-support.json DSXView row keeps status partial); the composed native-surface semantics are native-owned per OpenSource/Documentation/architecture/web-surface-policy.md, so the host's own a11y (labelled role=status unavailable card) is not held to the library axe/keyboard bar on this renderer. Red-by-record. |
| ios | review | 2026-08-18 | Renders native SwiftUI from the fetched DSX, so standard component semantics apply unchanged (the kernel a11y pass applies on any element (StackStyle.apply, OpenSource/Engine/Swift/Stack.swift:6060-6092: a11yLabel/aria-label, a11yHint, a11yValue, a11yTrait/role, a11yGroup, a11yHidden; on:tap implies .isButton)); the component adds no chrome of its own. ClosedSource/DSX/Modules/Mandatory/Foundation/Components/Views/DSXView/swift/DSXView.swift. Verified-by-review; the visual capture awaits the iOS capture lane. |
| android | review | 2026-08-18 | VERIFIED-BY-REVIEW: the rendered remote markup carries its own element semantics (every element renders through the same StackNodeView pipeline); the surface adds no chrome needing labels beyond the kernel spinner placeholder (DSXViewComponent.kt). |
| desktop | unaudited | unaudited | none recorded |

Every element carries `aria-label`, `aria-description`, `aria-valuetext`, `role`, `aria-pressed` and `aria-hidden`. A control that draws an icon beside text is one group with one label, never two announcements; see the [universal attributes](/components/attributes).

This page is GENERATED by ClosedSource/scripts/generate_component_docs.rb. A hand edit here is overwritten on the next run by design: fix the ledger instead (the attribute and event contract in `OpenSource/Documentation/reference/stack-elements.json`, the platform support and the audit in `OpenSource/Conformance/library/matrix.json`, the description and the web limits in `OpenSource/Engine/TypeScript/support/element-support.json`, the specimen in `OpenSource/Catalog`).
