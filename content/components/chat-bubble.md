# chat-bubble

The global Web twin renders the directional bubble, bound value/children, semantic colors, and bounded width.

Category: Display - Live specimens: the [System gallery](/system).
</RefMeta>

## Usage

```dsx
<chat-bubble side="left"><text value="Hey there!"/></chat-bubble>
```

`chat-bubble` takes children.

## Catalog specimen

The catalog has no specimen for `chat-bubble` at the default rung yet, so there is nothing to copy here. It appears with no change to this page the moment the catalog carries one: the page is a projection of the catalog, not a screenshot of it.

## States

| Renderer | Audited | Dated | Evidence |
|---|---|---|---|
| web | n/a | 2026-08-18 | Non-interactive display/layout surface: no rest/hover/pressed/focus/disabled axis (value-driven rendering is data, not interaction state; Skeleton IS the loading state). |
| ios | n/a | 2026-08-18 | Non-interactive display/layout surface: no rest/hover/pressed/focus/disabled axis (value-driven rendering is data, not interaction state; Skeleton IS the loading state). |
| android | n/a | 2026-08-18 | Non-interactive display/layout surface: no rest/hover/pressed/focus/disabled axis (value-driven rendering is data, not interaction state; Skeleton IS the loading state). |
| desktop | unaudited | unaudited | none recorded |

Rest, hover on a fine pointer, pressed, focus visible and disabled, in both colour schemes, plus loading, error and empty where the component has them.

## Attributes

| Attribute | Type | Default | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|
| `side` | `left` \| `right` | `left` |  |

Every element also carries the [universal attributes](/components/attributes): accessibility, animation, `class`, `style` and the platform suffixes.

## Events

`chat-bubble` raises no events.

## Platform notes

| Renderer | Grammar | What that means |
|---|---|---|
| web | `supported` | the built in renderer implements this element |
| ios | `reference` | the reference renderer this element is specified against |
| android | `enforced` | implemented and pinned by the element parity test |
| desktop | `uncaptured` | no desktop capture has measured it, which claims nothing in either direction |

The global Web twin renders the directional bubble, bound value/children, semantic colors, and bounded width.

**Known limits on the web**

- Web uses the neutral DSX token skin rather than cloning a native messaging bubble.

Declared platforms: `ios`, `android`, `web`.

**Adaptivity (web, 2026-08-18).** identical fluid presentation at both widths (data family page 390+1366, overflow 0); RTL page mirrors (ChatBubble sides flip: firstFromRight=0) - w8 Chromium probe (compileComponent->bootDsx, full skin), scratchpad/w8/*.mjs, shots/w8-audit-*

## Theming

DSX has one styling vocabulary and it is CSS. Three doors reach this element, and they differ only in how often the look repeats: `style="..."` for a declaration list on one element, `class="..."` for a name declared in a `<style>` block, and the component's own sheet for everything a whole screen shares.

On the web this element's root carries `dsx-chat-bubble dsx-chat-left`, the stable class the contract application CSS targets. It is a rendering fact you can read, not a styling hook to depend on: style the element, not the class the renderer stamps.

Web runtime: `global`.

## Accessibility

| Renderer | Audited | Dated | Evidence |
|---|---|---|---|
| web | yes | 2026-08-18 | text content readable, no spurious roles; axe 0 serious/critical on the data family page light (dark: text link finding filed separately) |
| ios | review | 2026-08-18 | Layout wrapper: slot content carries its own semantics; the bubble fill is a shape (no stray a11y element); the kernel a11y pass applies on any element (StackStyle.apply, OpenSource/Engine/Swift/Stack.swift:6060-6092: a11yLabel/aria-label, a11yHint, a11yValue, a11yTrait/role, a11yGroup, a11yHidden; on:tap implies .isButton). ClosedSource/DSX/Modules/Mandatory/Foundation/Components/Core/swift/ChatBubble.swift. Verified-by-review; the visual capture awaits the iOS capture lane. |
| android | review | 2026-08-18 | VERIFIED-BY-REVIEW: text content inside a styled bubble reads as plain text (BasicText); no interactive plane, no roles required (Displays.kt ChatBubbleElement). |
| desktop | unaudited | unaudited | none recorded |

Every element carries `aria-label`, `aria-description`, `aria-valuetext`, `role`, `aria-pressed` and `aria-hidden`. A control that draws an icon beside text is one group with one label, never two announcements; see the [universal attributes](/components/attributes).

This page is GENERATED by ClosedSource/scripts/generate_component_docs.rb. A hand edit here is overwritten on the next run by design: fix the ledger instead (the attribute and event contract in `OpenSource/Documentation/reference/stack-elements.json`, the platform support and the audit in `OpenSource/Conformance/library/matrix.json`, the description and the web limits in `OpenSource/Engine/TypeScript/support/element-support.json`, the specimen in `OpenSource/Catalog`).
