# Components

81 components, one page each. Every page is a projection of the ledgers: the census for the attribute and event contract, the library matrix for the audited platform record, the web element ledger for the limits, and the catalog for the specimen. Nothing on a page is written by hand, so nothing on a page can quietly go stale.

62 of the 81 have a specimen the catalog serves today; the rest say so on their own page.

## Layout

</Card>
<Card title="pager" href="/components/pager">
The structural/binding twin renders horizontal/vertical snap paging with two-way current-page binding, keyed bound pages, selection dots, and change events - the full pager.json attribute contract.

</Card>
<Card title="section-footer" href="/components/section-footer">

</Card>
<Card title="section-header" href="/components/section-header">
The base Web twin renders the list section header from markup, writing the same class and the same part name the bound group_by emitter writes, so one look has two ways in and a reader hears the group's own name either way.

The overlay twin provides modal alert semantics, focus containment/restoration, bound presentation, normalized actions, and dismissal.
</Card>
<Card title="command-palette" href="/components/command-palette">
The global Web twin is the stock command palette: a combobox over a grouped listbox, opened by its chord or its present key, reading the sidebar destinations, the live shortcut owners, the declared commands and the bound lists, ranked by the shared PaletteCore laws, with arrow, Return and Escape keys, restored focus and a full-height compact sheet.
</Card>
<Card title="confirm-dialog" href="/components/confirm-dialog">

<Card title="drawer" href="/components/drawer">
The application-control Web twin implements BOTH declared presentations: the modal drawer (adaptive geometry, focus containment and restoration, background inerting, Escape and scrim dismissal, bounded content, 120px drag dismissal) and, at the shared desktop step, the standing drawer pinned in flow (collapse-to-rail control, keyboard- and pointer-resizable drag hairline within min/max, honest complementary semantics, no scrim or focus trap).
</Card>
<Card title="lightbox" href="/components/lightbox">
The media Web twin provides a shared-top-layer modal gallery with bounded safe sources, reactive presentation/index, focus containment/restoration, keyboard and RTL paging, pointer swipe, interactive drag dismissal, responsive controls, deterministic SSR, and the native zoom ladder: pinch (pointer pairs and trackpad ctrl+wheel) and double-tap zoom toward the focal point (1..4x), pan while zoomed with the native lock (pager and dismiss-drag disabled, chrome hidden), Escape unwinding zoom before dismissal, per-page zoom reset.

</Card>
<Card title="scene" href="/components/scene">
The DSX-native scene root renders in the browser through the in-kernel WebGL surface installed by registerSceneSurface, over the same corpus-pinned scene fold (transform composition, projection, picking) the two native lanes and the Compose desktop rasterizer read, so a scene cannot mean one thing here and another on a phone.
</Card>
<Card title="scene-360" href="/components/scene-360">
The panorama renders over the kernel `<scene>` engine's WebGL surface: an inside-out sphere textured with the equirectangular src, the camera at its centre, drag to look (yaw/pitch, pitch clamped), wheel and pinch on the field of view (20 to 110), yaw/pitch/fov reactive; loading, ready and failed fire as on iOS.
</Card>
<Card title="scene-3d" href="/components/scene-3d">
The viewer renders over the kernel `<scene>` engine's WebGL surface (packages/dom/src/scene3d.ts): one internal `<scene>` per instance (camera, key and ambient light, the GLB model centred and resting on the floor, one node per models= row) driven through the scene bus with the iOS orbit rig (drag, wheel and pinch, autoRotate), the clip and loop, the live scale and the clip clock hold; loading, ready {ar, animations, bounds}, failed {reason}, tap {node} and animationFinished fire on the element and the scene3d channel, and the scene3d verbs reach it through Core/Scene3D/web.
</Card>
</CardGroup>

## Data

<CardGroup cols="2">
<Card title="chart" href="/components/chart">
The rich Web twin renders accessible SVG line, area, bar and point charts from bound data - multi-series with palette or single color=, stacked= areas and bars (domain from the stack totals, bands closing on the previous layer), legend= at the census positions (a figcaption, so assistive tech reads it as the caption), xType=time positioning by parsed timestamps with the kernel timeTicks ladder, y2Key/y2Color riding a labeled secondary axis, animate= draw-in (reduced-motion instant), interpolation=linear|smooth|monotone|step, grids, and deterministic downsampling.
</Card>
<Card title="map" href="/components/map">
The rich Web twin renders a REAL basemap when tiles= names a source - a self-hosted Protomaps .pmtiles archive (range-read, MVT-decoded, canvas-painted in the Despia neutral language with archive-metadata attribution) or a raster {z}/{x}/{y} template - plus accessible pins and pointer/keyboard pan/zoom; without tiles= it is the honest offline coordinate plane.
</Card>
</CardGroup>

## Web

<CardGroup cols="2">
<Card title="dsx-view" href="/components/dsx-view">
The rich Web twin mounts the screen component src names from this build's compiled registry (the web reading of the native rule that a shipped tag of the same name always wins), with reactive src re-resolution, the stable dsx-view lifecycle events, and a labelled unavailable state.
</Card>
<Card title="dsx-web-view" href="/components/dsx-web-view">
The rich Web twin mounts the composed app web surface as the same policy-constrained iframe WebView rides, resolving path against this page's own origin (an explicit origin wins) with the shared lifecycle events and the named-surface controls the Dom facet targets.
</Card>
<Card title="webview" href="/components/webview">
The rich Web twin provides a policy-constrained iframe, lifecycle events, named controls, safe URL schemes, and ephemeral isolation.
</Card>
</CardGroup>

## Beyond the elements

<CardGroup cols="2">
<Card title="Declarations" href="/components/declarations">
The tags that render nothing and declare everything: state, actions, formulas, styles, slots.
</Card>
<Card title="Universal attributes" href="/components/attributes">
The vocabulary every element carries: accessibility, animation, class, style, platform suffixes.
</Card>
<Card title="Native first elements" href="/components/native-only">
The rows whose essence is a platform or vendor runtime the web renderer does not ship.
</Card>
</CardGroup>

This page is GENERATED by ClosedSource/scripts/generate_component_docs.rb. A hand edit here is overwritten on the next run by design: fix the ledger instead (the attribute and event contract in `OpenSource/Documentation/reference/stack-elements.json`, the platform support and the audit in `OpenSource/Conformance/library/matrix.json`, the description and the web limits in `OpenSource/Engine/TypeScript/support/element-support.json`, the specimen in `OpenSource/Catalog`).
