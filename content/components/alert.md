# alert

The overlay twin provides modal alert semantics, focus containment/restoration, bound presentation, normalized actions, and dismissal.

<RefMeta platforms="Web,iOS,Android">
Category: Overlay - Live specimens: the [System gallery](/system).
</RefMeta>

## Usage

```dsx
<alert present="dsx.variable.showAlert" title="Saved" message="Your changes are safe."/>
```

`alert` takes no children.

## Catalog specimen

`AlertDefault.dsx`, verbatim from the catalog:

```dsx
<vstack style="width: 100%; gap: 8px">
  <head>
    <variable as="showAlert">return false</variable>
  </head>
  <button label="Show the alert" style="width: 100%" on:tap="dsx.variable.showAlert = true"/>
  <alert present="dsx.variable.showAlert" title="Saved" message="Your changes are safe."/>
</vstack>
```

Every component in the library is authored at four rungs in the catalog (default, system words, one property override, fully custom), so the cost of leaving the system design is visible in one place. The [System gallery](/system) runs them.

## States

| Renderer | Audited | Dated | Evidence |
|---|---|---|---|
| web | yes | 2026-08-18 | probe: opens, focus moves in, OK button, Escape fires on:dismiss - w8 Chromium probe (compileComponent->bootDsx, full skin), scratchpad/w8/*.mjs, shots/w8-audit-* |
| ios | review | 2026-08-18 | Present/dismiss lifecycle on the two-way present bool with on:dismiss on ANY close path (dsxOnChange, ClosedSource/DSX/Modules/Mandatory/Foundation/Components/Structure/Alert/swift/Alert.swift); buttons map system roles (cancel bold, destructive red), empty list falls back to a localized OK; pressed/focus states belong to the system alert. Verified-by-review; the visual capture awaits the iOS capture lane. |
| android | review | 2026-08-18 | VERIFIED-BY-REVIEW: REAL M3 AlertDialog (Dialogs.kt): Material owns touch states, scrim, system BACK; buttons= roles map to primary/error emphasis; empty buttons fall back to localized OK; every button dispatches then closes (Dialogs.kt header). |
| desktop | unaudited | unaudited | none recorded |

Rest, hover on a fine pointer, pressed, focus visible and disabled, in both colour schemes, plus loading, error and empty where the component has them.

## Attributes

| Attribute | Type | Default | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|
| `buttons` | `expr` |  |  |
| `confirm-text` | `string` |  |  |
| `message` | `string` |  |  |
| `on:dismiss` | `action` |  |  |
| `present` | `expr` |  |  |
| `title` | `string` |  |  |

Every element also carries the [universal attributes](/components/attributes): accessibility, animation, `class`, `style` and the platform suffixes.

## Events

| Event | Handler |
|---|---|
| `dismiss` | `on:dismiss="..."` |

A payload arrives FLAT in the handler scope, so a declared action names the key bare (`message="message"`), never through an `event` plane.

## Platform notes

| Renderer | Grammar | What that means |
|---|---|---|
| web | `supported` | the built in renderer implements this element |
| ios | `reference` | the reference renderer this element is specified against |
| android | `enforced` | implemented and pinned by the element parity test |
| desktop | `uncaptured` | no desktop capture has measured it, which claims nothing in either direction |

**Known limits on the web**

- Web uses DSX modal chrome rather than a browser alert() or native alert skin.

Declared platforms: `ios`, `android`, `web`.

**Adaptivity (web, 2026-08-18).** centered dialog at 1366; 390: fits 358px inside safe margins (left 16 / right 374) - w8 Chromium probe (compileComponent->bootDsx, full skin), scratchpad/w8/*.mjs, shots/w8-audit-*

## Theming

DSX has one styling vocabulary and it is CSS. Three doors reach this element, and they differ only in how often the look repeats: `style="..."` for a declaration list on one element, `class="..."` for a name declared in a `<style>` block, and the component's own sheet for everything a whole screen shares.

On the web this element's root carries `dsx-overlay-host dsx-alert-host`, the stable class the contract application CSS targets. It is a rendering fact you can read, not a styling hook to depend on: style the element, not the class the renderer stamps.

Web runtime: `overlay`.

## Accessibility

| Renderer | Audited | Dated | Evidence |
|---|---|---|---|
| web | yes | 2026-08-18 | role=alertdialog, focus moves in, Escape dismisses, axe clean while open light+dark - w8 Chromium probe (compileComponent->bootDsx, full skin), scratchpad/w8/*.mjs, shots/w8-audit-* |
| ios | review | 2026-08-18 | The system alert is fully accessible by construction (VoiceOver focus capture, button traits, role weights); labels localize via DSXStrings (ClosedSource/DSX/Modules/Mandatory/Foundation/Components/Structure/Alert/swift/Alert.swift). Verified-by-review; the visual capture awaits the iOS capture lane. |
| android | review | 2026-08-18 | VERIFIED-BY-REVIEW: M3 AlertDialog accessibility is component-owned (Dialogs.kt header lists accessibility + system BACK); titles/messages/labels localize through DSXStrings. |
| desktop | unaudited | unaudited | none recorded |

Every element carries `aria-label`, `aria-description`, `aria-valuetext`, `role`, `aria-pressed` and `aria-hidden`. A control that draws an icon beside text is one group with one label, never two announcements; see the [universal attributes](/components/attributes).

This page is GENERATED by ClosedSource/scripts/generate_component_docs.rb. A hand edit here is overwritten on the next run by design: fix the ledger instead (the attribute and event contract in `OpenSource/Documentation/reference/stack-elements.json`, the platform support and the audit in `OpenSource/Conformance/library/matrix.json`, the description and the web limits in `OpenSource/Engine/TypeScript/support/element-support.json`, the specimen in `OpenSource/Catalog`).
