# Notify

Handles the notification permission, the device token, Android channels, action buttons, badges, images, scheduled notifications and what happens when a user taps one. Use it when you want notifications built in rather than through OneSignal, Firebase. You send pushes from your own server with your own Apple push key.

**When to use it.** Reach for it when your app needs to remind, alert or message people outside the app, from your own server or from the device itself. If you already use a push vendor, keep it and use this package only for the local side.

<PackageSample/>

## What you need on your side

- Local notifications need nothing else.
- For remote pushes without a push service, your server sends them to Apple (APNs) and Google (FCM) with the token from the `notify.token` broadcast. Or use [OneSignal](/packages/onesignal) or [Firebase](/packages/firebase).

Despia never hosts your app, your backend or your users' content: the accounts and servers above are your own.

For apps built on Despia V3, see [Migrate from Despia V3](/migrate/web-view-apps).
