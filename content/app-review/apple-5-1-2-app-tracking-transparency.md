# App Tracking Transparency

**Apple App Review Guideline 5.1.2**. Read the official text: [App Review Guidelines](https://developer.apple.com/app-store/review/guidelines/#data-use-and-sharing).

## What it means

Tracking a user across other companies' apps and websites needs the App Tracking Transparency prompt first, the choice must be respected, and the App Store privacy labels must match.

## Why Despia apps hit it

Ad and attribution SDKs, or web tracking added later through an over-the-air update, track without the prompt, or the privacy labels say "no tracking".

## How to fix it

Request permission with `await dsx.module.apptracking.permission.request()` from the [App Tracking package](/packages/apptracking) before any tracking SDK starts, and keep the privacy labels in step with every package that tracks.


## Reply to the reviewer

Adapt it to what you actually changed; reply in App Store Connect (Resolution Center) only after the fix is in the build you submit.

```text
Thank you. The app now shows the App Tracking Transparency prompt before [SDK] starts, and does not track when permission is denied. The App Privacy section in App Store Connect has been updated to declare [data types].
```
