# Subscriptions and paywalls

**Apple App Review Guideline 3.1.2** · Google Play: Subscriptions policy. Read the official text: [App Review Guidelines](https://developer.apple.com/app-store/review/guidelines/#subscriptions), [Google Play policy center](https://play.google.com/about/developer-content-policy/).

## What it means

A paywall must state what is bought, the price and billing period, and the trial terms clearly, be easy to dismiss, and never trick the user into a purchase.

## Why Despia apps hit it

Conversion-optimised web paywalls carry dark patterns: tiny prices, the most expensive plan preselected, hidden close buttons, "Continue" that buys, fake urgency or social proof.

## How to fix it

Present store products with `await dsx.module.revenuecat.paywall()` (the store's own terms and prices), keep a visible close control, and show price, period and trial end next to the purchase button.


## Reply to the reviewer

Adapt it to what you actually changed; reply in App Store Connect (Resolution Center) only after the fix is in the build you submit.

Thank you. The paywall now shows the full price and billing period beside each plan, states when the free trial ends and what is charged after it, preselects no plan, and has a visible close button. A screenshot of the updated paywall is attached.
