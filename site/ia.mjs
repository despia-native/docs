//  ia.mjs - THE information architecture of the Despia V4 docs, declared once (PLAN.md shows the same tree).
//  Top tabs = the sections. Each section's sidebar = its groups, in reading order. A page that is in the tree but has no
//  content file yet builds as a short "being written" page so no link in the chrome is ever a 404.
//  section ids are also the export's `section` field (dist/docs-index.json): dsx | convert | web-apps | packages | ship | home.
