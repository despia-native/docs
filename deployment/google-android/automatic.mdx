## **Prerequisites**

Before you begin, ensure you have:

- A **deployed web application** with HTTPS enabled
- Access to the **Despia platform**
- **Google Play Console account** (\$25 one-time registration fee)
- **Design software** (Canva recommended for icon/splash creation)
- Basic understanding of Android app submission process

---

## **Initial Setup in Despia**

### **Configure Your Web App Source**

Navigate to your Despia project dashboard and locate the **Dynamic App Store Source** section.

**Critical Requirements:**

- Your URL **must** use HTTPS (HTTP will not work)
- Verify the URL is correct and accessible

**Verification Steps:**

1. Copy your web app URL from Despia
2. Open a new browser tab
3. Paste and load the URL
4. Confirm your application loads correctly

> **Common Error:** Typos in the URL will cause build failures. Always test your URL before proceeding.

## **Creating App Icons**

### **Requirements**

Android requires **two different icons**:

| **Icon Type** | **Purpose**            | **Dimensions** | **Format** | **Background**  |
| :------------ | :--------------------- | :------------- | :--------- | :-------------- |
| iOS Icon      | Internal use           | 1024 x 1024 px | PNG        | No transparency |
| Android Icon  | Launcher & home screen | 1024 x 1024 px | PNG        | No transparency |

> **Important:** Even if you're only building an Android app, you must upload both iOS and Android icons.

### **Differences Between Icons**

**iOS Icon:**

- Less safe area required
- Logo can be closer to edges
- Standard padding

**Android Icon:**

- Requires significant safe area
- Logo must be centered with extra padding
- Android zooms into icons, so elements must be smaller
- Despia provides a preview of how it will appear on Android devices

### **Creating Icons in Canva**

#### **iOS Icon**

1. **Create New Design**
   - Set dimensions: 1024 x 1024 px
   - Choose a background color (no transparency)
2. **Design Your Icon**
   - Upload your logo
   - Center with standard padding
   - Use solid background color
3. **Export Settings**
   - File type: **PNG**
   - Quality: High
   - **Disable "Transparent Background"**
4. **Upload to Despia**
   - Navigate to iOS Icon section
   - Click "Upload Icon"
   - Drag and drop your PNG file

#### **Android Icon**

1. **Create New Design**
   - Set dimensions: 1024 x 1024 px
   - Use same background as iOS icon
2. **Design Considerations**
   - Make logo smaller than iOS version
   - Add significant safe area padding
   - Keep critical elements away from edges
   - Center the logo
3. **Preview in Despia**
   - Despia shows preview of Android display
   - Verify nothing gets cut off
   - Adjust if needed
4. **Export Settings**
   - File type: **PNG**
   - Quality: High
   - **Disable "Transparent Background"**
5. **Upload to Despia**
   - Navigate to Android Icon section
   - Click "Upload Icon"
   - Verify preview looks correct

### **Common Icon Mistakes**

| **Issue**                         | **Result**               |
| :-------------------------------- | :----------------------- |
| Wrong dimensions (not 1024x1024)  | Build failure            |
| Transparent background            | Build failure            |
| JPEG format                       | Build failure            |
| Logo too close to edges (Android) | Elements cut off         |
| Missing iOS icon                  | Cannot build Android app |

---

## **Creating Splash Screens**

### **Requirements**

- **Dimensions:** 1024 x 1024 pixels
- **Format:** GIF (can be static or animated)
- **Background:** **Must have transparent background** (opposite of icons!)

> **Critical Difference:** Icons cannot have transparent backgrounds, but splash screens **must** have transparent backgrounds.

### **Creating the Splash Screen**

1. **Design in Canva**
   - Use 1024 x 1024 dimensions
   - Center your logo
   - Make logo fill most of the frame
   - Optionally add animations:
     - Fade in
     - Blur in
     - Swipe effects
     - Bounce animations
2. **Export as GIF**
   - Select "Download" → "GIF"
   - **Enable "Transparent Background"** (critical!)
   - Choose animation settings if applicable
   - Download to your computer
3. **Upload to Despia**
   - Scroll to "Splash Screen Layout" section for Android
   - Click "Upload Icon"
   - Select your GIF file
   - Click "Done"
   - Verify splash screen appears correctly
