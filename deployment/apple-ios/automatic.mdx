## Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have:

- An active **Apple Developer Account** (\$99/year)
- A **deployed web application** with HTTPS enabled
- Access to the **Despia platform**
- **Design software** (Canva recommended for icon/splash creation)
- Basic understanding of iOS app submission process

---

## Initial Setup in Despia

### 1. Configure Your Web App Source

Navigate to your Despia project dashboard and locate the **Dynamic App Store Source** section.

**Critical Requirements:**

- Your URL **must** use HTTPS (HTTP will not work)
- Verify the URL is correct and accessible

**Verification Steps:**

1. Copy your web app URL from Despia
2. Open a new browser tab
3. Paste and load the URL
4. Confirm your application loads correctly

> **Common Error:** Typos in the URL will cause build failures. Always test your URL before proceeding.

---

## Creating App Icons

### Requirements

- **Dimensions:** 1024 x 1024 pixels (exactly)
- **Format:** PNG
- **Background:** No transparency allowed
- **Safe Area:** Leave adequate padding around logo elements

### Step-by-Step Process

#### Using Canva

1. **Create New Design**
   - Set custom dimensions: 1024 x 1024 px
   - Choose a background color (no transparency)
2. **Design Your Icon**
   - Upload your logo
   - Center and size appropriately
   - Leave safe margins (Apple will apply corner radius)
   - Avoid placing critical elements at edges
3. **Export Settings**
   - File type: **PNG**
   - Quality: **High**
   - **Disable "Transparent Background"** (critical!)
4. **Upload to Despia**
   - Navigate to iOS Icon section
   - Click "Upload Icon"
   - Drag and drop your PNG file
   - Wait for upload confirmation

### Common Icon Mistakes

| :------------------------------- | :--------------- |
| Wrong dimensions (not 1024x1024) | Build failure    |
| Transparent background           | Apple rejection  |
| JPEG format                      | Build failure    |
| Logo too close to edges          | Elements cut off |

---

## Creating Splash Screens

### Requirements

- **Dimensions:** 1024 x 1024 pixels
- **Format:** GIF (can be static or animated)
- **Design:** Logo should fill most of the frame

### Creating the Splash Screen

   - Design with your logo centered
   - Add animations (optional):
     - Blur in
     - Fade in
     - Swipe
     - Party effects
     - Custom transitions
2. **Export as GIF**
   - Select "Download" → "GIF"

3. **Upload to Despia**
   - Scroll to "Splash Screen Layout" section
   - Click upload
   - Select your GIF file
   - Confirm upload

> **Tip:** Animated splash screens can make your app feel more polished, but keep animations under 2-3 seconds.

## Over-the-Air Updates

### Understanding OTA Updates

Despia apps support **over-the-air (OTA) updates**, meaning:

- Update web app and mobile app updates automatically
- No App Store review needed for web changes
- No rebuild required
- Instant deployment
- No cloud credits consumed

### When OTA Works

Changes that update automatically:

- UI/UX modifications
- Content updates
- Bug fixes in web code
- Feature additions (web-based)
- Style changes
- Business logic updates

### When Rebuild Required

You only need to rebuild when changing:

- Bundle IDs
- App capabilities
- Native configurations
- iOS icon
- Splash screen
- Push notification certificates
- Associated domains
- App Groups

**Rebuild Frequency:** Typically once or twice per year

### Testing OTA Updates

1. **Make Change in Web App**
   - Update your web application
   - Deploy to production
2. **Close Native App**
   - Force close the iOS app
   - Wait 2-3 seconds
3. **Reopen App**
   - Launch app again
   - Changes appear immediately

**Example:** Add a button to your web app → Close iOS app → Reopen → Button appears

> **Pro Tip:** Critical bug fixes can be deployed in minutes instead of waiting days for App Store review.
