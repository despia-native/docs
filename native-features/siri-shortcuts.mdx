  Add Siri shortcut functionality to my app using the Despia SDK from: [**https://www.npmjs.com/package/despia-native**](https://www.npmjs.com/package/despia-native)

  First, install the package: `npm install despia-native`

  Then import it: `import despia from 'despia-native'`

  Create a Siri shortcut system that uses Despia URLs like: `despia("addtosiri://?command={NATURAL-LANGUAGE-COMMAND}&jsFunction=siriFunction()")` where command contains the natural language phrase users will speak to Siri and jsFunction specifies the globally-defined JavaScript function to execute when the command is triggered.

  <Danger>
    **This feature requires native capabilities which will be fully provided by the "despia-native" npm package, no additional native libraries are needed!**
  </Danger>
  Please follow the installation instructions for the "despia-native" npm package closely, and do not modify my instructions. Implementation as mentioned is critical.
</Card>

**How it works:** Despia acts as a bridge between your Lovable app and Siri voice shortcuts. When users register a Siri shortcut with a natural language command like "Order Coffee", they can later speak that command to Siri. When triggered, your app opens and automatically executes the specified globally-defined JavaScript function, enabling hands-free voice-activated workflows and app interactions.

## Installation

Install the Despia package from NPM:

```
npm install despia-native
```

## Usage

### 1. Import the SDK

```javascript
import despia from 'despia-native';
```

### 2. Execute Add to Siri

Call the `despia()` function with an Add to Siri Command:

```javascript
despia("addtosiri://?command=Order Coffee&jsFunction=orderCoffee()");
```

## Shortcut Parameters

Siri shortcut URLs must include proper parameters:

- **command**: The natural language phrase users will speak to Siri to trigger the shortcut
- **jsFunction**: The globally-defined JavaScript function name to execute when Siri triggers the command (the function must be globally accessible in your app)

## Platform Support

Supports iOS devices with Siri:

- iPhone, iPad, iPod touch
- Apple Watch (when paired with iPhone)
- HomePod (when linked to user account)
- CarPlay (for supported voice commands)
