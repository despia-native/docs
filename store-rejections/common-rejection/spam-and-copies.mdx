## What are spam and copycat rejections?

**App stores reject apps that don't offer something different**

Apple's Guideline 4.3 (Spam) and Google's repetitive content policies reject apps that are near-duplicates of existing apps. If your app looks like a low-effort copy, it won't get approved.

Common rejection messages:

- "Your app duplicates the content and functionality of other apps"
- "We found that your app is similar to other apps already on the App Store"
- "Your app does not have sufficient unique content or features"
- "This app appears to be a copycat of [existing app]"

These rejections require you to differentiate before resubmitting.

## Why this happens

**The stores are flooded with copies**

Every successful app spawns hundreds of clones. App stores actively reject these to maintain quality and protect users from confusion.

Common triggers:

- Generic to-do app with no unique angle
- Calculator that looks like every other calculator
- Notes app with standard features only
- Habit tracker identical to dozens of others
- AI chatbot wrapper with no differentiation
- Social app copying a major platform's exact design

You don't need to be one in a million. But you can't be one of a million identical copies.

## How to fix it

### Find your one thing

**You need at least one differentiator**

Your app doesn't need to reinvent the category. It needs one thing that puts you in a smaller pond. One feature, one audience, one angle that makes you different from the mass of copies.

**Questions to find your differentiator:**

- Who specifically is this for? (not "everyone")
- What problem do you solve better than alternatives?
- What feature do competitors lack?
- What's your unique take on this category?
- Why would someone choose this over the established players?

**Examples of differentiation:**

| Generic app     | Differentiated version                              |
| :-------------- | :-------------------------------------------------- |
| To-do list      | To-do list for ADHD with dopamine-based rewards     |
| Notes app       | Notes app for lawyers with case linking             |
| Habit tracker   | Habit tracker for couples with shared goals         |
| Expense tracker | Expense tracker for freelancers with tax categories |
| AI chatbot      | AI chatbot for language learning with pronunciation |
| Fitness app     | Fitness app for people with chronic pain            |

The differentiated versions aren't revolutionary. They're focused. That's enough.

### Make it obvious in screenshots

**Reviewers decide in seconds**

Your differentiator must be visible in your App Store screenshots. If a reviewer has to dig to find what makes you different, they won't.

**What to show:**

- Your unique feature prominently in first screenshot
- Your specific audience in the tagline
- Your angle in the description text on screenshots
- Visual design that signals your niche

**Wrong approach:**

Screenshot 1: Generic home screen Screenshot 2: Generic feature Screenshot 3: Generic settings

**Right approach:**

Screenshot 1: "Habit tracking for couples" with shared dashboard Screenshot 2: Your unique feature in action Screenshot 3: What makes you different from standard habit trackers

Lead with your differentiator. Don't hide it.

### Position clearly in marketing copy

**Your App Store description must state your angle**

The first sentence should tell reviewers who this is for and why it's different. Don't bury your differentiator in paragraph four.

**Wrong:**

> "MyTasks is a beautiful to-do list app. Create tasks, set reminders, and stay organized. Features include..."

This describes every to-do app ever made.

**Right:**

> "MyTasks is built specifically for ADHD minds. Unlike traditional to-do lists, we break tasks into dopamine-friendly micro-steps and celebrate every completion. Built by someone with ADHD, for people with ADHD."

This tells reviewers immediately why this app deserves to exist alongside hundreds of other to-do apps.

---

### Avoid these patterns

**Instant rejection triggers:**

- App name is [Popular App] + one word (e.g., "Uber Driver Helper")
- UI is pixel-perfect copy of a major app
- Screenshots look identical to an established competitor
- Description uses same keywords without differentiation
- "Like [Famous App] but..." without a real difference
- Generic app with no stated audience or angle

**Gray areas that often get rejected:**

- "Minimal" or "simple" as the only differentiator
- Different color scheme but same features
- Same app targeting different country (without localization)
- Template-based app with no customization

---

### Prove you're not spam

**Reviewers look for signals of effort**

Beyond features, reviewers assess whether this is a genuine product or a low-effort cash grab.

**Signals of a real app:**

- Custom design (not just a template)
- Thoughtful onboarding explaining your angle
- About page with real team/creator information
- Support contact that works
- Privacy policy specific to your app
- Screenshots that show real content, not lorem ipsum

**Signals of spam:**

- Stock photos everywhere
- Generic descriptions with keyword stuffing
- No real brand identity
- Multiple similar apps from same developer
- Broken links or placeholder content

---

### The "thousands in a million" test

**You don't need to be unique. You need to be specific.**

Think of the app market as a funnel:

- Million apps total
- Hundred thousand in your category
- Ten thousand with your core features
- Thousands with your specific angle ← **Be here**
- Hundreds in your exact niche

If someone describes your app and it could apply to 100,000 others, you're too generic. If it applies to a few thousand, you're specific enough.

**Too generic:** "A notes app with folders and search" **Specific enough:** "A notes app for medical students with anatomy diagrams and flashcard integration"

The second one still has competitors. But it's in a smaller pond. That's the goal.

---

### Resubmission strategy

**If rejected for spam/copycat, you need visible changes**

Don't just add a minor feature and resubmit. Reviewers will see you made minimal effort.

**Before resubmitting:**

1. Define your clear differentiator (audience, feature, or angle)
2. Update screenshots to lead with that differentiator
3. Rewrite first paragraph of description to state your unique position
4. Add visual elements that support your angle
5. Consider updating app name to reflect your niche

**In your reviewer notes:**

Explain what makes your app different and who it's specifically for. Help reviewers understand why this deserves a place in the store.

**Example reviewer note:**

> "This habit tracker is specifically designed for couples who want to build habits together. Unlike individual habit trackers, it features shared goals, partner accountability, and joint streaks. Our target users are couples in long-distance relationships who use habit sharing to stay connected. We've included features like timezone sync and shared celebration notifications that don't exist in general-purpose habit apps."

## Quick checklist

**Differentiation:**

1. One clear differentiator identified (audience, feature, or angle)
2. Differentiator is real, not just "minimal design"
3. Differentiator visible without digging through the app

**App Store presence:**

4. First screenshot shows what makes you different
5. First sentence of description states your unique angle
6. App name doesn't copy established apps
7. Screenshots show your specific features, not generic screens

**Quality signals:**

 8. Custom design, not an unmodified template
 9. Real content in screenshots, not placeholders
10. Working support contact and privacy policy
11. No multiple similar apps from same account

## Still stuck?

If you keep getting rejected for spam/copycat:

1. Search the App Store for similar apps. What do approved apps have that you don't?
2. Ask yourself honestly: "Why would someone choose my app over the top 5 in this category?"
3. Consider pivoting to a more specific niche rather than competing broadly
4. Contact support: [support@despia.com](mailto:support@despia.com) with:
   - Your rejection notice in full
   - Your App Store screenshots
   - Description of what makes your app different
   - Who your specific target audience is
