## What are user-specific data rejections?

**App stores reject apps that collect unnecessary personal information**

Apple and Google enforce data minimization. If your app asks for gender, birthday, phone number, or other personal details without a clear reason tied to app functionality, it will be rejected.

Common rejection messages:

- "Your app collects user data that is not necessary for its functionality"
- "The app requests personal information without clear justification"
- "Data collection does not appear to be required for the app's core features"
- "Your app asks for information that is not relevant to its purpose"

These rejections require removing unnecessary data collection or clearly justifying it.

---

## Why this happens

**Data minimization is a core privacy principle**

Both Apple and Google require apps to collect only data that's necessary for the app to function. Collecting data "just in case" or for unspecified future use is not allowed.

Common mistakes:

- Asking for gender in a calculator app
- Requiring birthday for a notes app
- Collecting phone number when email is sufficient
- Mandatory profile fields that aren't used anywhere
- Copying signup forms from web without considering necessity
- Collecting data for analytics or marketing without disclosure

---

## How to fix it

### Only collect what you use

**Every data field must serve a clear purpose in your app**

Before asking for any personal information, answer: "What feature breaks if we don't have this?"

If you can't point to a specific feature that needs the data, don't collect it.

| Data field   | Acceptable reason                     | Not acceptable                     |
| :----------- | :------------------------------------ | :--------------------------------- |
| Gender       | Fitness app calculating calorie needs | Social app "for personalization"   |
| Birthday     | Age-restricted content verification   | Generic app "for birthday rewards" |
| Phone number | SMS-based authentication              | "To contact you about updates"     |
| Location     | Map/navigation features               | "To improve our services"          |
| Full name    | Legal/financial transactions          | "To personalize your experience"   |
| Photo        | Profile-based social features         | Notes app "for your account"       |

### Remove unnecessary fields

**The easiest fix is deletion**

If a data field isn't essential, remove it entirely. You can always add it later when you have a clear use case.

**Common fields to reconsider:**

- Gender (rarely needed outside health/fitness)
- Birthday (rarely needed outside age verification)
- Phone number (email often sufficient)
- Full legal name (username often sufficient)
- Address (only needed for shipping/delivery)
- Profile photo (only needed for social features)

**Before:**

```
Sign Up
- Email *
- Password *
- Full Name *
- Gender *
- Birthday *
- Phone Number *
- Address
```

**After:**

```
Sign Up
- Email *
- Password *
```

Collect additional data only when the user accesses features that need it.

### Make optional fields truly optional

**If it's not required, don't require it**

If you want to offer personalization but the data isn't essential, make the field optional and explain why you're asking.

- Profile (optional)
  - Display Name - Shown to other users in comments
  - Birthday (optional) - We'll send you a special offer on your birthday

**Users can skip optional fields. If most of your users skip a field, that's a sign you don't need it.**

---

### Justify collection in the app

**Explain why you need each piece of data**

If data is truly necessary, explain it at the point of collection. Reviewers look for this.

**Wrong:**

```
Gender
○ Male
○ Female
○ Other
```

No explanation. Reviewer will ask why a to-do app needs gender.

**Right:**

```
Biological Sex
○ Male
○ Female

This is used to calculate your basal metabolic rate 
and personalize calorie recommendations.
```

Clear connection to app functionality.

---

### Collect data progressively

**Ask for data when it's needed, not upfront**

Don't front-load all data collection in signup. Collect information when the user reaches features that need it.

**Wrong flow:**

1. Signup: Email, password, name, gender, birthday, phone, location
2. App: User never uses features that need most of that data

**Right flow:**

1. Signup: Email, password
2. Later: User uses fitness feature → Ask for gender/weight

This shows reviewers that each piece of data has a purpose.

---

### Update privacy disclosure

**Your privacy policy must explain data usage**

Every piece of data you collect must be disclosed in your privacy policy with a clear explanation of why.

**Required for each data type:**

- What data you collect
- Why you need it (specific feature or purpose)
- How you use it
- Who you share it with (if anyone)
- How users can delete it

If you can't write a clear justification in your privacy policy, you probably shouldn't collect it.

### Special categories require extra care

**Some data types have additional restrictions**

Certain data categories are considered sensitive and require stronger justification:

**Health data:**

- Only collect if app is health-focused
- Must explain specific health feature that needs it
- Additional App Store disclosures required

**Financial data:**

- Only collect if processing payments or providing financial services
- Must have appropriate security measures
- Often requires additional compliance

**Location data:**

- Must have clear feature requiring location
- "While using" vs "Always" must match actual need
- Explain in location permission prompt

**Contacts/Photos:**

- Only access if user explicitly uses sharing/import feature
- Don't request on first launch
- Explain what you'll do with access

---

### What reviewers check

**Reviewers evaluate data necessity during review**

They will:

- Sign up and note every data field requested
- Check if collected data appears anywhere in the app
- Verify data fields connect to visible features
- Read your privacy policy for justification
- Flag mismatches between collection and usage

**Red flags for reviewers:**

- Many required fields during signup
- Personal data collected but never displayed/used
- No explanation for why data is needed
- Privacy policy doesn't mention collected data
- Data fields that don't match app category

---

## Quick checklist

**Before collecting any data:**

1. Can the app function without this data?
2. What specific feature uses this data?
3. Is this the minimum data needed for that feature?
4. Can this be optional instead of required?
5. Is collection explained at point of request?

**For your app:**

 6. Signup only asks for essential fields
 7. Additional data collected progressively when needed
 8. Optional fields are clearly marked optional
 9. Each field has visible use in the app
10. Privacy policy explains all data collection

## Common rejection reasons

| Rejection                       | Fix                                         |
| :------------------------------ | :------------------------------------------ |
| "Collects unnecessary data"     | Remove fields not tied to specific features |
| "Gender/birthday not justified" | Remove or explain connection to feature     |
| "Too much data at signup"       | Move to progressive collection              |
| "No explanation for data use"   | Add context text at point of collection     |
| "Privacy policy mismatch"       | Update policy to match actual collection    |

---

## Still stuck?

If you keep getting rejected for data collection:

1. List every data field you collect and write one sentence explaining the feature that needs it
2. If you can't write that sentence, remove the field
3. Have someone unfamiliar with your app sign up and ask "why are they asking for this?" at each field
4. Contact support: [support@despia.com](mailto:support@despia.com) with:
   - Your rejection notice in full
   - List of data fields you collect
   - Explanation of why each field is needed
   - Screenshot of your signup/profile flow
