## What are deceptive paywall rejections?

**App stores protect users from manipulative purchase flows**

Apple and Google reject apps that trick users into purchases, hide important pricing information, or make it difficult to understand what they're buying.

Common rejection messages:

- "The app uses deceptive or manipulative subscription practices"
- "Subscription terms are not clearly displayed"
- "The app does not clearly identify the price and terms of the subscription"
- "Users may not understand what they are purchasing"
- "The free trial terms are not sufficiently clear"

These rejections require paywall redesign before resubmission.

---

## Why this happens

**Dark patterns trigger automatic rejection**

Reviewers are trained to spot manipulative purchase flows. Even unintentional design choices can look deceptive.

Common mistakes:

- Hiding the price or showing it in tiny text
- Pre-selecting the most expensive option
- Making the close button hard to find
- Unclear free trial terms (when it ends, what it costs after)
- "Continue" buttons that actually purchase
- No way to dismiss the paywall
- Subscription auto-renewing without clear disclosure
- Fake urgency ("Sale ends in 5 minutes!")
- Fake social proof ("10,000 users subscribed today!")

Apple specifically calls out "bait and switch" tactics where users think they're getting one thing but are charged for another.

## How to fix it

### Make pricing impossible to miss

**Price must be prominent and clear**

The price should be one of the most visible elements on your paywall. Users should never have to search for it.

**What causes rejection:**

- Price in tiny text at the bottom
- Price hidden behind "See details" link
- Price only visible after scrolling
- "Continue" button with no price visible
- Price shown without currency symbol

**What passes review:**

- Price displayed prominently near the purchase button
- Full price with currency symbol (\$9.99, not just 9.99)
- Billing frequency stated clearly (per month, per year)
- Auto-renewal disclosed near the price
- Readable font size (minimum 14pt)

**Example of clear pricing text:**

> "\$9.99/month, auto-renews monthly. Cancel anytime."

This single line covers price, frequency, renewal, and cancellation. Put it where users can't miss it.

---

### Make the close button obvious

**Users must be able to dismiss the paywall easily**

A hidden or delayed close button is an instant rejection. Users should never feel trapped.

**What reviewers look for:**

- Close button visible immediately (no delay)
- Close button in expected location (top-left or top-right)
- Close button large enough to tap easily (44x44pt minimum)
- Close button has sufficient contrast to be visible

**Bad patterns that cause rejection:**

- Close button appears after 3 seconds
- Close button is a tiny "X" in low contrast
- Close button hidden behind other elements
- "Skip" text that looks like body copy
- No close button at all

**Good implementation:**

```html
<div class="paywall">
  <button class="close-button" onclick="dismissPaywall()">
    <svg width="24" height="24" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentColor" stroke-width="2">
      <path d="M18 6L6 18M6 6l12 12"/>
    </svg>
  </button>
  
  <!-- Paywall content -->
</div>
```

```css
.close-button {
  position: absolute;
  top: 16px;
  right: 16px;
  width: 44px;
  height: 44px;
  display: flex;
  align-items: center;
  justify-content: center;
  background: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.1);
  border-radius: 50%;
  border: none;
}
```

### Be transparent about free trials

**Trial terms must be crystal clear**

Free trial rejections are extremely common. Users must understand exactly when they'll be charged and how much.

**Required disclosures for trials:**

- Trial duration ("7-day free trial")
- What happens when trial ends ("Then \$9.99/month")
- When the first charge occurs ("You won't be charged until January 28, 2025")
- How to cancel ("Cancel anytime in Settings")

**What causes rejection:**

- "Start Free Trial" button with no other information
- Trial length buried in terms of service
- Post-trial price not mentioned
- No indication of when charges begin
- Implying the trial is free forever

**What passes review:**

- All four disclosures visible on the same screen as the button
- Specific date when trial ends and billing begins
- Clear statement that no charge happens today
- Cancellation instructions visible

**Example of clear trial text:**

> "7-day free trial, then \$9.99/month. You won't be charged until January 28, 2025. Cancel anytime in your device settings."

### Don't pre-select expensive options

**Let users choose their plan**

Pre-selecting the annual plan (or any paid option) feels manipulative to reviewers, especially if it's not the cheapest option.

**Acceptable approaches:**

- No option pre-selected (user must tap to choose)
- Cheapest option pre-selected
- Most popular option highlighted but not pre-selected

**Rejection triggers:**

- Most expensive option pre-selected
- Only option visible is the expensive one
- Cheaper options hidden in "See all plans"

---

### Use honest button labels

**Button text must match the action**

The button should clearly indicate what happens when tapped.

**Wrong:**

- "Continue" (then charges immediately)
- "Next" (then starts subscription)
- "Get Started" (ambiguous)
- "Unlock" (unclear if paid)

**Right:**

- "Subscribe for \$9.99/month"
- "Start Free Trial"
- "Purchase for \$29.99"
- "Subscribe" (with price clearly shown nearby)

---

### Avoid fake urgency and scarcity

**No countdown timers or false claims**

Reviewers reject obvious manipulation tactics.

**Instant rejection triggers:**

- "Sale ends in 04:59" (fake countdown)
- "Only 3 spots left!" (fake scarcity)
- "50% off today only!" (always-on "sale")
- "10,000 users upgraded this hour" (unverifiable)
- "Last chance!" (repeating message)

**What's acceptable:**

- Legitimate limited-time promotions (with real end dates)
- Actual user counts if verifiable
- Seasonal sales that actually end

If your "sale" has been running for six months, it's not a sale. Reviewers will notice.

### Use RevenueCat paywalls

**Pre-built paywalls are designed for compliance**

RevenueCat's native paywalls are built to meet App Store and Google Play guidelines. They handle pricing display, trial terms, and required disclosures automatically.

```javascript
import despia from 'despia-native';

// Launch compliant native paywall
despia('revenuecat://launchPaywall?external_id=user_123&offering=default');
```

The paywall pulls product information directly from the stores, ensuring prices and terms are always accurate and properly formatted.

See: [RevenueCat Paywalls](https://setup.despia.com/lovable/native-features/paywalls)

**Benefits of native paywalls:**

- Pricing pulled from App Store / Play Store
- Localized currency and formatting
- Trial terms displayed correctly
- Compliant by design
- Close button included

If you're building custom paywalls, follow the guidelines above carefully. RevenueCat paywalls eliminate most compliance risks.
