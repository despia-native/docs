## What are privacy policy rejections?

**Every app that collects data needs a privacy policy**

Apple and Google require a privacy policy for any app that collects, transmits, or shares user data. This includes most apps, even simple ones.

Common rejection messages:

- "Your app does not include a privacy policy"
- "The privacy policy URL is not valid or accessible"
- "The privacy policy does not adequately describe data collection practices"
- "Your app collects user data but the privacy policy does not disclose this"

No privacy policy means no approval.

## Why this happens

**Privacy policies are legally required in most regions**

GDPR, CCPA, and other regulations require disclosure of data practices. App stores enforce this for all apps distributed globally.

Common mistakes:

- No privacy policy at all
- Privacy policy URL returns 404
- Privacy policy hosted on localhost or staging
- Generic template that doesn't match your app
- Missing disclosures for specific data types (location, contacts, health)
- Privacy policy doesn't mention third-party SDKs
- Different privacy policy in app vs App Store listing

---

## How to fix it

### Create a privacy policy

**Every app needs one, even if you think you don't collect data**

If your app uses analytics, crash reporting, push notifications, or any third-party SDK, you're collecting data. You need a privacy policy.

**What must be included:**

- What data you collect
- How you collect it
- Why you collect it
- How you use it
- Who you share it with
- How users can delete their data
- How to contact you

**Data types to disclose:**

| Data Type      | Examples                                      |
| :------------- | :-------------------------------------------- |
| Personal info  | Name, email, phone number                     |
| Device info    | Device ID, IP address, OS version             |
| Location       | GPS, IP-based location                        |
| Usage data     | Pages viewed, features used, session duration |
| Contacts       | Address book access                           |
| Health data    | HealthKit, fitness data                       |
| Financial data | Payment info, purchase history                |
| User content   | Photos, files, messages                       |

If your app accesses any of these, your privacy policy must mention it.

### Disclose third-party SDKs

**You're responsible for data collected by SDKs you include**

Most apps include SDKs that collect data. Your privacy policy must disclose these.

**Common SDKs that collect data:**

- **Analytics:** Google Analytics, Mixpanel, Amplitude, Firebase Analytics
- **Crash reporting:** Crashlytics, Sentry, Bugsnag
- **Push notifications:** OneSignal, Firebase Cloud Messaging
- **Payments:** RevenueCat, Stripe
- **Advertising:** AdMob, Facebook Ads, AppLovin
- **Authentication:** Google Sign-In, Facebook Login, Auth0

**For each SDK, disclose:**

- What data it collects
- Link to the SDK's privacy policy
- Why you use it

**Example disclosure:**

> "We use OneSignal for push notifications. OneSignal collects device identifiers and push tokens to deliver notifications. See OneSignal's privacy policy at https://onesignal.com/privacy_policy"

---

### Host your privacy policy properly

**The URL must be accessible and stable**

Reviewers will check that your privacy policy URL works.

**Requirements:**

- Publicly accessible (no login required)
- Loads over HTTPS
- Returns a real page (not 404 or redirect loop)
- Available 24/7 (not localhost or staging server)
- Same URL used in app and App Store listing

**Good hosting options:**

- Your company website (`https://yourapp.com/privacy`)
- Notion public page
- GitHub Pages
- Google Docs (published to web)
- Dedicated legal page services

**What causes rejection:**

- URL returns 404 or error
- URL requires login to view
- URL redirects to homepage
- URL is localhost or internal IP
- Different URLs in app vs store listing

---

### Add privacy policy to your app

**Users must be able to access it from within the app**

The privacy policy can't only be on the App Store. Users need to find it in your app too.

**Where to place it:**

- Settings screen (most common)
- Account or profile screen
- Onboarding flow
- Login/signup screen
- App footer or menu

**Implementation:**

```javascript
// Link to privacy policy
const openPrivacyPolicy = () => {
  window.open('https://yourapp.com/privacy', '_blank');
};
```

Make sure the link opens in a browser, not in the WebView where it might fail.

---

### Match App Store privacy labels

**Your privacy policy must match your App Store declarations**

Apple requires privacy nutrition labels. Google requires a data safety section. These must match your privacy policy.

**If your App Store listing says you collect:**

- Location data → Privacy policy must mention location collection
- Contact info → Privacy policy must mention contact collection
- Usage data → Privacy policy must mention analytics

**Mismatches cause rejection:**

- App Store says "no data collected" but you use analytics
- Privacy policy mentions email collection but App Store doesn't list it
- App accesses contacts but neither discloses it

Review your App Store privacy labels and privacy policy together. They must tell the same story.

### Include account deletion instructions

**Required by Apple since 2022**

If your app supports account creation, users must be able to delete their account and data.

**Requirements:**

- Clear instructions for account deletion in privacy policy
- Working deletion mechanism in app or via request
- Data actually gets deleted (not just deactivated)
- Deletion available without contacting support (preferred)

**What to include in privacy policy:**

> "You can delete your account and all associated data at any time from Settings \> Account \> Delete Account. Alternatively, email [privacy@yourapp.com](mailto:privacy@yourapp.com) to request deletion. We will process deletion requests within 30 days."

If you don't offer account creation, you don't need this. But if you do, account deletion is mandatory.

---

### Use a proper template

**Don't write from scratch unless you're a lawyer**

Privacy policy generators and templates help you cover required elements.

**Free generators:**

- Termly (https://termly.io)
- FreePrivacyPolicy (https://freeprivacypolicy.com)
- PrivacyPolicies.com (https://privacypolicies.com)

**What to customize:**

- Your company/app name
- Contact information
- Specific data types you collect
- Third-party SDKs you use
- Account deletion process
- Data retention periods

Don't use a template without customizing it. Reviewers can tell when the privacy policy doesn't match the app.

---

### Update when you add features

**Privacy policy must reflect current app behavior**

When you add new features that collect data, update your privacy policy.

**Triggers for update:**

- Adding analytics SDK
- Adding push notifications
- Adding location features
- Adding contacts access
- Adding health/fitness features
- Adding camera/photo access
- Adding payment processing
- Adding social login

Update the privacy policy before submitting the app update. Reviewers check that disclosures match current functionality.
