title: "MCP Server"
description: "Ship true native features for your web-native apps faster and with more precision using the Despia MCP."
---

The Despia Documentation MCP provides AI code builders with documentation and context about the `despia-native` npm package.

**MCP URL:** `https://setup.despia.com/mcp`

---

## **Web-Based AI Builders (Lovable, Bolt, v0, etc.)**

If your tool supports MCP, just paste the URL:

```
https://setup.despia.com/mcp
```

Look for "Add MCP" or "MCP Settings" in your builder.

**No MCP support?** Copy/paste the relevant feature pages from [**<u>setup.despia.com</u>**](http://setup.despia.com) directly into your builder's chat.

## **Requirements (Local Tools Only)**

- Node.js v18+

## **What It Does**

The MCP gives your AI assistant knowledge about:

- How to use `despia-native`
- Available native features (push notifications, biometrics, widgets, etc.)
- Correct syntax and implementation patterns

Your AI can then write correct Despia code without you explaining the API.
