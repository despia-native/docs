title: "Missing Item"
description: "Your paywall is empty or checkout isn't working. Products aren't loading. Here's how to debug it."

## What is this error?

When RevenueCat can't fetch your products, nothing works. Paywalls show empty, direct checkout fails, and users can't purchase anything.

You might see this in your debug logs:

<Warning>
  **There's a problem with your configuration. None of the products registered in the RevenueCat dashboard could be fetched from the [Play Store/App Store].**
</Warning>

This means RevenueCat knows what products you configured, but the store on the device can't find them. The issue is almost always a configuration mismatch somewhere in the chain. This affects both paywall UI and direct product purchases the same way.

---

## How it works

Understanding the flow helps you debug:

1. You configure products in App Store Connect or Google Play Console
2. You add those same product IDs to RevenueCat dashboard
3. RevenueCat SDK asks RevenueCat API for product IDs
4. SDK asks the device's store for actual product details
5. Store returns product info (or nothing if misconfigured)

If any step has a mismatch, products won't load.

---

## Despia configuration

**Before debugging anything else, verify your Despia setup.**

### Use live API keys only

**Despia only supports live RevenueCat API keys. Test keys will crash the app.**

In RevenueCat, you have two types of API keys:

- **Live keys** (use these) - Work in production and sandbox testing
- **Test keys** (do not use) - Will crash Despia apps

Live keys work for both production purchases and sandbox testing. You don't need test keys.

### 1. Add RevenueCat API keys in Despia dashboard

Go to Despia Dashboard \> Your App \> Settings \> RevenueCat and add:

- **iOS API Key** - Live key starting with `appl_`
- **Android API Key** - Live key starting with `goog_`

These keys connect your native app to your RevenueCat project. Use live keys from RevenueCat Dashboard \> API Keys (not test keys).

### 2. Rebuild the app after changes

**RevenueCat keys are baked into the native app at build time.**

If you:

- Added or changed RevenueCat API keys
- Changed your RevenueCat project
- Switched between RevenueCat projects

You must rebuild the app in Despia for both iOS and Android.

### 3. Install the latest build

After rebuilding, make sure you're testing with the new version:

**iOS:**

- Delete the old app from your device
- Install the new build from TestFlight

**Android:**

- Uninstall the old app
- Go to Google Play Console \> Testing \> Internal testing
- Copy the internal testing link
- Open the link on your test device and install from the Play Store

**Common mistake:** Testing with an old app version that has outdated or missing RevenueCat keys.

### 4. Verify the keys are correct

Double-check you copied the right keys:

1. RevenueCat Dashboard \> Your Project \> API Keys
2. Copy the **live** iOS key (starts with `appl_`)
3. Copy the **live** Android key (starts with `goog_`)
4. Paste into Despia Dashboard \> Settings \> RevenueCat
5. Rebuild both platforms
6. Test on fresh installs

**Do not use test keys.** Live keys work for sandbox testing.

---

## iOS troubleshooting

### 1. Check App Store Connect agreements

**The most common cause of missing products on iOS.**

Go to App Store Connect \> Agreements, Tax, and Banking. Verify:

- Paid Applications Agreement is signed
- Banking details are complete
- Tax forms are submitted

If you recently renewed your Apple Developer Program or signed new agreements, wait 24 hours for propagation.

---

### 2. Verify Apple Developer Program is active

Go to [developer.apple.com](http://developer.apple.com) and check:

- Membership is active (not expired)
- Valid payment method on file
- Auto-renew is enabled

If your membership expired and you renewed it, agreements need to be re-accepted.

---

### 3. Add In-App Purchase Key

RevenueCat needs your In-App Purchase Key to fetch products and validate purchases.

**To create it:**

1. App Store Connect \> Users and Access \> Integrations \> In-App Purchase
2. Generate a new key
3. Download the .p8 file (you can only download once)
4. Note the Key ID and Issuer ID

**To add it to RevenueCat:**

1. RevenueCat Dashboard \> Your Project \> iOS App
2. Upload the .p8 file
3. Enter Key ID and Issuer ID

---

### 4. Check product status in App Store Connect

Products must be in the correct state:

| Status             | Can fetch? |
| :----------------- | :--------- |
| Ready to Submit    | Yes        |
| Approved           | Yes        |
| Waiting for Review | No         |
| In Review          | No         |
| Missing Metadata   | No         |
| Rejected           | No         |

**First in-app purchase?** You must submit it with a new app version. You cannot submit products separately without the app.

---

### 5. Verify product identifiers match exactly

Product IDs are case-sensitive. Check that the ID in RevenueCat matches App Store Connect exactly.

**In App Store Connect:** App \> In-App Purchases \> Your Product \> Product ID

**In RevenueCat:** Products \> Your Product \> App Store Product Identifier

Common mistakes:

- Extra spaces
- Different capitalization
- Typos in either place

---

### 6. Verify Bundle ID matches

The Bundle ID must match in three places:

1. App Store Connect \> Your App \> Bundle ID
2. RevenueCat Dashboard \> Your App \> Bundle ID
3. Despia Dashboard \> Your App \> Bundle ID

This is case-sensitive.

---

### 7. Check API key platform

RevenueCat uses different API keys for iOS and Android. If you add the wrong key in Despia, products won't load.

**In Despia Dashboard \> Settings \> RevenueCat:**

- iOS field should have a key starting with `appl_`
- Android field should have a key starting with `goog_`

Despia automatically configures the correct key for each platform when you build. Just make sure you put the right key in the right field.

---

### 8. Test on a physical device

**Simulators cannot fetch products from the live App Store.**

Simulators only work with StoreKit Configuration files (local testing). To test real products:

1. Use a physical iPhone or iPad
2. Sign in with a Sandbox Apple Account (not your real account)
3. Go to Settings \> App Store \> Sandbox Account

---

### 9. Wait after release

New products can take up to 24 hours to propagate after:

- First app release with IAP
- Adding new products to an existing app
- Changing product configuration

---

## Android troubleshooting

### 1. Check Google Play Console agreements

Go to Google Play Console \> Settings \> Developer account \> Account details.

Verify:

- Developer agreement accepted
- Payments profile set up
- Bank account verified

---

### 2. Publish on a testing track

**Google requires your app to be published before products can be fetched.**

Even for testing, you need to upload your app to a testing track. Internal testing is fastest.

**To set up internal testing:**

1. Google Play Console \> Your App \> Testing \> Internal testing
2. Create a release and upload your app bundle
3. Add testers (your email)
4. Roll out the release
5. Copy the internal testing link to install on your device

Products cannot be fetched from an unpublished app.

---

### 3. Add yourself as a licensed tester

Licensed testers can make test purchases without being charged.

**To add:**

1. Google Play Console \> Settings \> License testing
2. Add your Google account email
3. Set license response to "RESPOND_NORMALLY"

Use the same Google account that's signed in on your test device.

---

### 4. Verify product identifiers match exactly

Product IDs are case-sensitive. Check that the ID in RevenueCat matches Google Play Console exactly.

**In Google Play Console:** Monetize \> Products \> Subscriptions (or In-app products) \> Product ID

**In RevenueCat:** Products \> Your Product \> Play Store Product Identifier

---

### 5. Verify package name matches

The package name must match in three places:

1. Google Play Console \> Your App \> Package name
2. RevenueCat Dashboard \> Your App \> Package Name
3. Despia Dashboard \> Your App \> Package Name

This is case-sensitive.

---

### 6. Check API key platform

Make sure you added the Android API key in the Android field in Despia.

**In Despia Dashboard \> Settings \> RevenueCat:**

- Android field should have a key starting with `goog_`
- iOS field should have a key starting with `appl_`

Despia automatically configures the correct key for each platform when you build.

---

### 7. Test on a physical device

Emulators have limited store functionality. Use a physical Android device with:

- Google Play Store installed
- Signed in with your licensed tester account
- App installed from internal testing link (Play Console \> Testing \> Internal testing)

---

### 8. Check product status

Products must be Active in Google Play Console:

| Status   | Can fetch? |
| :------- | :--------- |
| Active   | Yes        |
| Inactive | No         |

Make sure your subscription or in-app product is activated.

---

### 9. Wait after release

New products can take up to 24 hours to propagate after:

- First app release with IAP
- Adding new products
- Changing product configuration
- Publishing to a new track

---
