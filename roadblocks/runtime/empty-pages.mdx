## Check your URL first

**No https:// or missing SSL certificate**

If you're serving remotely via the link in Despia Editor \> Dynamic App Source, you need a valid HTTPS URL like `https://example.com`.

Common mistakes:

- Missing `https://` prefix (just `example.com` won't work)
- No SSL certificate installed
- Certificate expired or invalid

Fix: Add `https://` and make sure your SSL cert is valid. Test the URL in a browser first.

## Local server not loading

**White screen with local server enabled**

If local server is on but you're seeing a white screen:

1. **Try closing and reopening the app.** Old cache is often the culprit.
2. **Verify your manifest.** Check that `/despia/local.json` returns valid structure:

```json
{
  "entry": "/index.html",
  "assets": [
    "/index.html",
    "/assets/app.abc123.css",
    "/assets/app.def456.js",
    "/assets/logo.xyz789.png"
  ]
}
```

Test it: Open `https://yourapp.com/despia/local.json` in a browser. You should see the JSON above.

3. **Make sure it's a client-side app.** Server-side apps won't work with local server.

**Using Next.js?** You need to build a static export:

- Add `output: 'export'` to `next.config.js`
- Run `npm run build`
- Entry point must be `index.html`

Static export docs: https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/deploying/static-exports

## Routing issues

**Link is correct, local server is off, but still white screen**

This is usually a routing problem. Common causes:

### Trailing slash issues

WebView environments sometimes add trailing slashes (`/`) to URLs. If your router doesn't handle this, it breaks.

**Example problem:**

- Your app expects: `https://example.com/dashboard`
- WebView requests: `https://example.com/dashboard/`
- Router doesn't match, shows blank

**Fix:** Update your router config to handle trailing slashes. Most frameworks have built-in support:

**React Router:**

```tsx
// Handle both /dashboard and /dashboard/
<Route path="/dashboard/*" element={<Dashboard />} />
```

**Vue Router:**

```javascript
// Set strict: false to handle trailing slashes
const router = createRouter({
  strict: false,
  routes: [...]
})
```

**Next.js:**

```javascript
// next.config.js
module.exports = {
  trailingSlash: true // or false, just be consistent
}
```

### Redirect loops

**Example problem:**

- App start URL in Despia: `https://example.com/auth`
- Auth redirects logged-in users to: `https://example.com/home/`
- Trailing slash breaks routing
- Infinite redirect loop or blank screen

**Fix:** Make sure your redirects use consistent URL formats. Either always use trailing slashes or never use them.

## DNS and www issues

**www subdomain not configured**

If you point Despia to `https://www.example.com` but haven't set up the www subdomain, you'll get a blank screen.

**Check:** Does `https://www.example.com` work in a browser? If not, you have two options:

1. **Remove www from Despia:** Change link to `https://example.com`
2. **Add www support to DNS:** Configure www subdomain in your DNS settings

**Important:** DNS changes can take hours to propagate. If you just made DNS changes:

- Wait a few hours
- Uninstall and reinstall the app
- Don't panic if it doesn't work immediately

## Quick debugging checklist

1. ✓ URL has `https://` prefix
2. ✓ SSL certificate is valid (test in browser)
3. ✓ Local server manifest at `/despia/local.json` is valid
4. ✓ App is client-side (not server-rendered)
5. ✓ Router handles trailing slashes
6. ✓ No redirect loops
7. ✓ www/non-www matches your DNS setup
8. ✓ If using Next.js, built with static export

## Still stuck?

If none of this helps:

1. Test your URL in a regular mobile browser (Safari/Chrome). Does it work there?
2. Check browser console for errors (use remote debugging)
3. Contact support: [support@despia.com](mailto:support@despia.com) with:
   - Your app URL
   - Screenshot of white screen
   - Browser console errors (if any)
   - Whether local server is on/off
