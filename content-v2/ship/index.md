description: From a project to the App Store and Google Play: connect your store accounts once, build on Despia Cloud, test, submit and release.
---

Shipping works the same for a DSX app and a converted web app. Despia builds and signs the app on Despia Cloud with your own store credentials, and every step can run from the Despia Console, the CLI or your agent.

::: steps

### Connect your store accounts

Once per workspace: an [App Store Connect Key](/ship/app-store-connect) for iOS and a [Google Play Service Account](/ship/google-play) for Android. Despia tests each one before it saves it.

### Build

Press **Build** in the Despia Console, or run `despia build ios --cloud` and `despia build android --cloud`. See [Builds](/ship/builds).

### Test

Send the build to TestFlight or a Google Play testing track, and invite testers. See [Releases](/ship/releases).

### Submit and release

Submit the build for review. When the store approves it, release it, all at once or to a share of your users first.

## What ships where

| Change | How it reaches people |
| :-- | :-- |
| Your web app's code (Convert) | Deploy your site as usual. The app shows the new version on its next launch. |
| DSX screens, routes and styles | An over-the-air bundle. No store review. |
| Packages, permissions, the app icon and name, the bundle ID | A new store build. |

## Before you submit

- **The store listing.** `despia store listing pull` writes your store text into files, `despia store listing lint` checks every field and screenshot against the store limits, and `despia store listing apply` uploads your edits.
- **Privacy answers.** `despia store declarations` drafts the App Privacy and Data safety answers from the packages your app uses.
- **What the stores refuse.** `despia validate` checks a build for what an upload would reject.
- **App Review.** [App Review](/app-review) explains the guidelines apps run into and how to pass them.
