title: Agent skills
description: Skills teach a coding agent how to write, structure, review and ship DSX apps. Install the pack once and your agent loads the right one when it needs it.
---

A skill is a short, focused guide written for an agent: when to use it, the rules, and worked examples. Agents that support skills (Claude Code, Cursor, Codex and others) read the description of each one and load it when the task matches.

## Install

```sh
npx skills add despia-native/skills
```

The pack installs into your agent's skills folder. Run the same command again to update it.

## The skills

| Skill | What it teaches |
| :-- | :-- |
| [Building DSX apps with agents](/skills/building-dsx-apps-with-agents/SKILL.md) | Plan and build a large piece of a DSX project with one or many agents, with measured plans and safe parallel work. |

| [Audio](/skills/dsx-audio/SKILL.md) | Build audio in a DSX app. |
| [Components and reuse](/skills/dsx-components-and-reuse/SKILL.md) | Cut a DSX app into one root, panels and a library of configurable primitives, and never write the same markup twice. |
| [Runtime traps](/skills/dsx-runtime-traps/SKILL.md) | The DSX spellings that run, report success and do the wrong thing. |

| [Reviewing DSX apps](/skills/reviewing-dsx-apps/SKILL.md) | The loop to run before and after every change to a DSX project. |
| [Structuring DSX apps](/skills/structuring-dsx-apps/SKILL.md) | Where DSX state goes and when one document has become two. |
| [Thinking in DSX](/skills/thinking-in-dsx/SKILL.md) | The React and React Native to DSX translation table. |
| [Using the Despia CLI](/skills/using-the-despia-cli/SKILL.md) | The whole despia command surface, structural verbs first. |
| [Writing DSX apps](/skills/writing-dsx-apps/SKILL.md) | Write correct DSX app markup. |

Three skills are in the installable pack today: **Designing DSX apps**, **Thinking in DSX** and **Writing DSX apps**. The others are published here so you can read them now, and join the pack with DSX's production release. Each link opens the skill's own `SKILL.md`, which you can also copy into your agent by hand.

## Where to start

- New to DSX: **Thinking in DSX** maps what you know from React and React Native to DSX, then **Writing DSX apps** covers the vocabulary.
- Building something large: **Structuring DSX apps** and **Components and reuse**.
- Before every change lands: **Reviewing DSX apps**.

Skills work best with the [MCP servers](/dsx/agents) connected, so the agent can check the docs and the package contracts while it works.
