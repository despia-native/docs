description: Scaffold a DSX app, run it, change it, check it and build it, in about five minutes.

You need Node 22.18 or newer, and nothing else. No Xcode, no Android Studio and no account to start.

::: steps

### Create the app

```sh
npm create despia@latest my-app
cd my-app
npm install
```

This writes a small project: `dsx.json` (the app's name and scheme), `dsx.config.json` (its entry component and routes), `Components/App.dsx` (the first screen), and an `AGENTS.md` and `CLAUDE.md` for the coding agent you use. See [Project structure](/dsx/project).

### Check it

```sh
npx despia doctor
```

`doctor` finds the project and machine mistakes that would make a build fail later. Every line should say `ok`.

### Run it

```sh
npx despia dev
```

Open `http://localhost:5273/`. The dev server rebuilds on every save. It also serves a framed preview at `/__dsx/preview` with device sizes and a light and dark switch. It listens on your machine only; `--host` opens it to your network and `--port` moves it.

### Change the screen

Replace `Components/App.dsx` with this and save:

```dsx title="Components/App.dsx"
<stack class="screen">
  <head>
    <attribute as="title" default="'Hello, DSX'"/>
    <variable as="count">return 0</variable>
    <action as="bump">
      dsx.variable.count = dsx.variable.count + 1;
    </action>
    <style>
      .screen { gap: 16px; padding: 32px; }
      .title { font-size: 28px; font-weight: 700; }
    </style>
  </head>
  <text class="title" value="{{ dsx.attribute.title }}"/>
  <text value="Tapped {{ dsx.variable.count }} times"/>
  <button label="Tap me" on:tap="dsx.action.bump()"/>
</stack>
```

The page updates as soon as the file is written. The look is standard CSS in the `<style>` sheet; the text and the count come from the head. [Pages and components](/dsx/documents) explains each part.

### Add a native feature

```sh
npx despia add haptic
```

This pins the Haptics package and adds it to `"modules"` in `dsx.config.json`. Now any action can call it:

```dsx title="Components/App.dsx"
<stack class="screen">
  <head>
    <variable as="count">return 0</variable>
    <action as="bump">
      dsx.variable.count = dsx.variable.count + 1;
      await dsx.module.haptic.light();
    </action>
    <style>
      .screen { gap: 16px; padding: 32px; }
    </style>
  </head>
  <text value="Tapped {{ dsx.variable.count }} times"/>
  <button label="Tap me" on:tap="dsx.action.bump()"/>
</stack>
```

On a phone, each tap now gives a light vibration. [Native features](/dsx/packages) covers results, errors and events.

### Lint it

```sh
npx despia lint
```

The linter checks every document: the markup, the code inside it, and the packages it calls. A call to a package you have not added is an error, with the command that fixes it.

### Build it

```sh
npx despia build
```

This compiles the project to a static site in `dist/`. To build the iOS or Android app on Despia Cloud, sign in and build with a platform:

```sh
npx despia login
npx despia build ios --cloud
```

A release build needs your App Store Connect Key or Google Play Service Account. See [Build and ship](/ship).
