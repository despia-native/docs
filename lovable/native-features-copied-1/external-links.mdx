  Add native link handling to control whether links open in Safari, in-app browser tabs, or navigate within your app using the Despia SDK from: [**https://www.npmjs.com/package/despia-native**](https://www.npmjs.com/package/despia-native)

  First, install the package: `npm install despia-native`

  Then import it: `import despia from 'despia-native'`

  Simply use `window.open(url, '_blank')` to open links in the in-app browser, or configure domains in Despia settings to force Safari opening for payment compliance.

  <Danger>
    **This feature requires native capabilities which will be fully provided by the “despia-native” npm package, no additional native libraries are needed!**
  </Danger>
  Please follow the installation instructions for the "despia-native" npm package closely, and do not modify my instructions. Implementation as mentioned is critical.
</Card>

**How it works:** Despia apps are native iOS and Android applications that handle link opening natively. When you use `window.open(url, '_blank')`, the Despia runtime automatically handles opening links in the in-app browser by default. You can configure specific domains in your Despia project settings to force them to open in Safari instead (required for payment compliance).

## **Installation**

Install the Despia package from NPM:

```
npm install despia-native
```

## **Usage**

### **1. Import the SDK**

```javascript
import despia from 'despia-native';
```

### **2. Open Links in In-App Browser**

Implement regular `_blank` link targets to open the in-app browser:

```javascript
// Payment flow (opens in Safari if domain is whitelisted)
const handleStripePayment = () => {
  window.open('https://buy.stripe.com/your-checkout', '_blank');
};

// Any external content (opens in in-app browser)
const openExternalLink = () => {
  window.open('https://example.com/help', '_blank');
};
```
