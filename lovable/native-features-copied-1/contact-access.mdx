  Add native contact access functionality to retrieve users' device contacts including names and phone numbers using the Despia SDK from: [**https://www.npmjs.com/package/despia-native**](https://www.npmjs.com/package/despia-native)

  First, install the package: `npm install despia-native`

  Then import it: `import despia from 'despia-native'`

  1. Request contact permission using `despia("requestcontactpermission://")`
  2. Read contacts using `await despia('readcontacts://', ['contacts'])` which returns a JSON object with contact names as keys and phone number arrays as values
  3. When accessing the data, use "dot notation" like `.contacts` to retrieve the contact data in a JSON object format. Here is an example of the structure returned:

  ```json
  {
    "John Appleseed": [
      "+12345678910"
    ],
    "Ann Wilson": [
      "+12345678910"
    ]
  }
  ```

  <Danger>
    **This feature requires native capabilities which will be fully provided by the “despia-native” npm package, no additional native libraries are needed!**
  </Danger>
  Please follow the installation instructions for the "despia-native" npm package closely, and do not modify my instructions. Implementation as mentioned is critical.
</Card>

**How it works:** The Despia SDK provides native bridge functionality to access device contacts through async method calls. First request permission, then read contacts data which returns as a JSON object with contact names as keys and arrays of phone numbers as values.

## **Installation**

Install the Despia package from NPM:

```
npm install despia-native
```

## **Usage**

### **1. Import the SDK**

```javascript
import despia from 'despia-native';
```

### **2. Request Permission and Read Contacts**

Access Native Device Contacts and process them:

```javascript
// Request permission first
await despia("requestcontactpermission://");

// Read contacts data
const contactsData = await despia('readcontacts://', ['contacts']);
console.log(contactsData.contacts); // Access "contacts" variable set as object key, from the "contactsData" const

// Expected output format:
{
  "John Appleseed": [
    "+12345678910"
  ],
  "Ann Wilson": [
    "+12345678910"
  ]
}
```
