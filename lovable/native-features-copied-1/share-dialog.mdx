<Card title="AI Prompt" icon="sparkles">
  Add social sharing functionality to my app using the Despia SDK from: [**https://www.npmjs.com/package/despia-native**](https://www.npmjs.com/package/despia-native)

  First, install the package: `npm install despia-native`

  Then import it: `import despia from 'despia-native'`

  Create a social sharing system that uses Despia URLs like: `` despia(`shareapp://message?=${message}&url=${url}`) `` where message contains the text content to share and url contains the link to share, triggering the device's native share dialog with pre-populated content.

  <Danger>
    **This feature requires native capabilities which will be fully provided by the “despia-native” npm package, no additional native libraries are needed!**
  </Danger>
  Please follow the installation instructions for the "despia-native" npm package closely, and do not modify my instructions. Implementation as mentioned is critical.
</Card>

**How it works:** Despia acts as a bridge between your Lovable app and native mobile sharing systems. When users tap a share button, Despia opens the device's native share dialog with pre-populated message content and URL, allowing users to share content through any app installed on their device, including social media platforms, messaging apps, email clients, and other sharing-enabled applications.

## **Installation**

Install the Despia package from NPM:

```
npm install despia-native
```

## **Usage**

### **1. Import the SDK**

```javascript
import despia from 'despia-native';
```

### **2. Execute Social Share Dialog**

Call the `despia()` function with a Social Share Command:

```javascript
despia(`shareapp://message?=${message}&url=${url}`);
```

### **Share Parameters**

Social share URLs must include proper parameters:

- **message:** Text content to include in the share dialog
- **url:** The URL/link to share alongside the message

### **Platform Support**

Supports all sharing platforms including:

- Social Media (Facebook, Twitter, Instagram, LinkedIn)
- Messaging Apps (WhatsApp, Telegram, iMessage, SMS)
- Email Clients (Gmail, Outlook, Apple Mail)
- Cloud Storage (Google Drive, Dropbox, iCloud)
- Clipboard and System Share
- Note-taking Apps (Evernote, OneNote, Apple Notes)
- And any other sharing-enabled application
