  Access clipboard content from native mobile devices in your application using the Despia SDK from: https://www.npmjs.com/package/despia-native

  First, install the package: `npm install despia-native`

  Then import it: `import despia from 'despia-native'`

  1. Import the Despia SDK in your component
  2. Read clipboard data using `await despia('getclipboard://', ['clipboarddata'])`
  3. Access the clipboard content through the returned object using `.clipboarddata`
  4. Display or process the clipboard content in your application

  <Danger>
    **This feature requires native capabilities which will be fully provided by the "despia-native" npm package, no additional native libraries are needed!**
  </Danger>
  Please follow the installation instructions for the "despia-native" npm package closely, and do not modify my instructions. Implementation as mentioned is critical.
</Card>

**How it works:** The Despia SDK provides native bridge functionality to access device clipboard through async method calls. The clipboard content is returned as a JSON object with the text content accessible via the `clipboarddata` key.

## Installation

Install the Despia package from NPM:

```
npm install despia-native
```

## Usage

### 1. Import the SDK

```javascript
import despia from 'despia-native';
```

### 2. Read Clipboard Content

Access the clipboard and display the content in your UI:

```tsx
// Simple example - read and display clipboard
const clipboardData = await despia('getclipboard://', ['clipboarddata']);
const content = clipboardData.clipboarddata;

// Display in UI
<p>Clipboard: {content}</p>

// Use in a React component
const handlePasteFromClipboard = async () => {
  const data = await despia('getclipboard://', ['clipboarddata']);
  setInputValue(data.clipboarddata);
};
```
