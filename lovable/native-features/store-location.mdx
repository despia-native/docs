  Access the user's current store location for location-based services and regional content in your application using the Despia SDK from: [**https://www.npmjs.com/package/despia-native**](https://www.npmjs.com/package/despia-native)

  First, install the package: `npm install despia-native`

  Then import it: `import despia from 'despia-native'`

  1. Import the Despia SDK in your component
  2. Access the store location using `despia.storeLocation`
  3. Display the store location in your UI
  4. Use the location data for regional content and localized features

  <Danger>
    **This feature requires native capabilities which will be fully provided by the "despia-native" npm package, no additional native libraries are needed!**
  </Danger>
  Please follow the installation instructions for the "despia-native" npm package closely, and do not modify my instructions. Implementation as mentioned is critical.
</Card>

**How it works:** The Despia Store Location SDK enables your application to access the user's current store location to provide location-based services, regional content, and localized experiences. This lightweight solution runs entirely client-side through `despia.storeLocation`, requiring no server-side setup or configuration.

## **Installation**

Install the Despia package from NPM:

```
npm install despia-native
```

## **Usage**

### **1. Import the SDK**

```javascript
import despia from 'despia-native';
```

### **2. Get Store Location**

Access the store location from the `despia.storeLocation` variable:

```tsx
// Simple example - show store location and checkout button
const storeLocation = despia.storeLocation;

// Display in UI
<div>
  <p>Your Store Location: {storeLocation}</p>
  
  {storeLocation === 'USA' && (
    <button onClick={handleWebPayment}>
      Checkout with Web Payment
    </button>
  )}
</div>

// Handle web payment for US users
const handleWebPayment = () => {
  // Process web payment
  console.log('Processing US web payment');
};
```

### **Backend Integration**

This is merely an illustration; your implementation may differ.

```javascript
// "/api/store-location" endpoint
export default async function handler(req, res) {
  const { userId, storeLocation, timestamp } = req.body;
  
  try {
    // Store the location data in your database
    await db.collection('user_locations').doc(userId).set({
      userId,
      storeLocation,
      lastChecked: timestamp,
      createdAt: timestamp
    }, { merge: true });

    res.status(200).json({ success: true });
  } catch (error) {
    res.status(500).json({ error: 'Failed to sync store location' });
  }
}
```
