<Note>
  **This setting is incredible for re-engaging users!** It allows you to re-request users to grant push notification access, which keeps users engaged in your app. You only get one chance to ask for push permission, but this setting also allows you to use the deep link feature to request it multiple times without any limit, all while using your own custom UI.

<Card title="Lovable Prompt" icon="sparkles">
  Add native settings navigation to my app using the Despia SDK from: https://www.npmjs.com/package/despia-native

  First, install the package: `npm install despia-native`

  Then import it: `import despia from 'despia-native'`

  Create a settings navigation system that uses the Despia command: `despia("settingsapp://")` to open your app's native settings page where users can manage permissions like notifications, location, camera, and more.

  <Danger>
    **This feature requires native capabilities which will be fully provided by the "despia-native" npm package, no additional native libraries are needed!**
  </Danger>
  Please follow the installation instructions for the "despia-native" npm package closely, and do not modify my instructions. Implementation as mentioned is critical.
</Card>

**How it works:** Despia acts as a bridge between your Lovable app and the native mobile OS. When triggered, Despia opens your app's dedicated settings page in the device's native settings application, allowing users to manage app-specific permissions, notifications, and preferences directly from the native interface.

## Installation

Install the Despia package from NPM:

```
npm install despia-native
```

## Usage

### 1. Import the SDK

```javascript
import despia from 'despia-native';
```

### 2. Open App Settings

Call the `despia()` function with the Settings Command:

```javascript
despia("settingsapp://")
```
