<Card title="Lovable Prompt" icon="sparkles">
  Add screenshot capture functionality to my app using the Despia SDK from: [**https://www.npmjs.com/package/despia-native**](https://www.npmjs.com/package/despia-native)

  First, install the package: `npm install despia-native`

  Then import it: `import despia from 'despia-native'`

  Create a screenshot capture system that uses Despia URLs like: `despia("takescreenshot://")` which captures the entire visible app page and automatically saves it to the device's camera roll.

  <Danger>
    **This feature requires native capabilities which will be fully provided by the "despia-native" npm package, no additional native libraries are needed!**
  </Danger>
  Please follow the installation instructions for the "despia-native" npm package closely, and do not modify my instructions. Implementation as mentioned is critical.
</Card>

**How it works:** Despia acts as a bridge between your Lovable app and native screenshot capture systems. When users trigger the screenshot command, Despia captures the full page content including all visible elements, renders it as a high-quality image, and automatically saves it to the device's photo gallery with proper permissions handling, making it instantly accessible in the camera roll for sharing or editing.

## Installation

Install the Despia package from NPM:

```
npm install despia-native
```

## Usage

### 1. Import the SDK

```javascript
import despia from 'despia-native';
```

### 2. Execute Screenshot Capture

Call the `despia()` function with a Screenshot Command:

```javascript
despia("takescreenshot://");
```

### Screenshot Features

The screenshot capture automatically includes:

- **Full Page Capture:** Captures entire visible app content
- **Auto-Save:** Automatically saves to device camera roll
- **High Quality:** Maintains original resolution and clarity
- **Instant Access:** Image immediately available in photo gallery
