  Add advanced haptic effect functionality to your mobile app using the Despia SDK from: [**https://www.npmjs.com/package/despia-native**](https://www.npmjs.com/package/despia-native)

  First, install the package: `npm install despia-native`

  Then import it: `import despia from 'despia-native'`

  Use the despia command function to trigger advanced haptic effects:

  - `despia("heavyhaptic://")` - Heavy haptic feedback with enhanced vibration patterns
  - `despia("lighthaptic://")` - Light haptic feedback for subtle interactions
  - `despia("successhaptic://")` - Success pattern for completed actions
  - `despia("warninghaptic://")` - Warning pattern for cautionary alerts
  - `despia("errorhaptic://")` - Error pattern for failed operations

  These commands create immersive tactile experiences and also register custom URL schemes for external triggering.

  <Danger>
    **This feature requires native capabilities which will be fully provided by the “despia-native” npm package, no additional native libraries are needed!**
  </Danger>
  Please follow the installation instructions for the "despia-native" npm package closely, and do not modify my instructions. Implementation as mentioned is critical.
</Card>

**How it works:** The Despia SDK provides advanced haptic effect capabilities through URL scheme commands. The `heavyhaptic://` command creates intense, layered vibration patterns that provide strong tactile feedback for critical interactions. It automatically adapts to device capabilities and provides optimized patterns for different hardware.

## **Installation**

Install the Despia package from NPM:

```
npm install despia-native
```

### **Usage** **1. Import the SDK**

```javascript
import despia from 'despia-native';
```

### **2. Advanced Haptic Effects**

Trigger Haptic Feedback on user interactions & events:

```javascript
// Heavy haptic effect with enhanced patterns
despia("heavyhaptic://");

// Light haptic feedback
despia("lighthaptic://");

// Success haptic pattern
despia("successhaptic://");

// Warning haptic pattern
despia("warninghaptic://");

// Error haptic pattern
despia("errorhaptic://");

// Example usage for critical actions
const handleCriticalAction = () => {
  despia("heavyhaptic://");
  // Important action here
};

// Example usage for confirmation dialogs
const handleConfirmation = (confirmed) => {
  if (confirmed) {
    despia("heavyhaptic://");
    executeAction();
  } else {
    despia("warninghaptic://");
  }
};

// Example usage for game events
const handleGameEvent = (eventType) => {
  switch (eventType) {
    case 'powerup':
      despia("heavyhaptic://");
      break;
    case 'damage':
      despia("errorhaptic://");
      break;
    case 'victory':
      despia("successhaptic://");
      break;
  }
};
```
