  Add local push notification functionality to my app using the Despia SDK from: [**https://www.npmjs.com/package/despia-native**](https://www.npmjs.com/package/despia-native)

  First, install the package: `npm install despia-native`

  Then import it: `import despia from 'despia-native'`

  Create a local push notification system that uses Despia URLs like: `despia(sendlocalpushmsg://push.send?s=${seconds}=msg!${message}&!#${title}&!#${url})` to schedule and send local notifications to users.

  <Danger>
    **This feature requires native capabilities which will be fully provided by the “despia-native” npm package, no additional native libraries are needed!**
  </Danger>
  Please follow the installation instructions for the "despia-native" npm package closely, and do not modify my instructions. Implementation as mentioned is critical.
</Card>

**How it works:** Despia acts as a bridge between your Lovable app and native mobile notification systems. When triggered, Despia schedules local notifications through the device's native notification API, allowing you to send timed messages, reminders, and updates directly to users even when the app is closed.

## **Installation**

Install the Despia package from NPM:

```
npm install despia-native
```

## **Usage**

### **1. Import the SDK**

```javascript
import despia from 'despia-native';
```

### **2. Send Local Push Notification**

Define your notification parameters:

```javascript
const seconds = 5;
const title = "Quick Reminder";
const message = "Don't forget to save!";
const url = "https://myapp.com/save";
```

Call the `despia()` function with a Local Push Command:

```javascript
despia(`sendlocalpushmsg://push.send?s=${seconds}=msg!${message}&!#${title}&!#${url}`)
```

## **Remote Push Notifications**

For server-sent remote push notifications (like marketing campaigns, real-time updates, or notifications sent from your backend), use our OneSignal integration instead: [**https://lovable.despia.com/default-guide/native-features/onesignal**](https://lovable.despia.com/default-guide/native-features/onesignal)
