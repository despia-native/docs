<Card title="Lovable Prompt" icon="sparkles">
  Add native rewarded ad functionality to my app using the Despia SDK from: https://www.npmjs.com/package/despia-native

  First, install the package: `npm install despia-native`

  Then import it: `import despia from 'despia-native'`

  Create a rewarded ad system that displays video advertisements and grants rewards to users who complete watching them. Use `despia("displayrewardedad://")` to trigger the ad display.

  Add a button that allows users to watch ads to earn rewards:

  e.g. "Watch Ad for 100 Coins", "Get Free Lives"

  <Note>
    The Despia Native Runtime will call the global function `updateRewardedStatus(status)` when a rewarded ad interaction occurs. You need to define this callback function in your code.
  </Note>
  **Important:** Only grant the reward to the user when the status parameter equals the string `'true'`. This means the ad was successfully watched to completion. If the status is anything other than `'true'`, do not grant any reward - the user either skipped the ad or it failed to complete.

  The function will receive the following data:

  ```javascript
  // Example value passed into the updateRewardedStatus() function call by the native runtime
  
  updateRewardedStatus('true');  // Only grant reward when status === 'true'
  ```

  <Danger>
    **This feature requires native capabilities which will be fully provided by the "despia-native" npm package, no additional native libraries are needed!**
  </Danger>
  **Important Security Considerations:**

  Always verify the user agent includes "despia" to prevent unauthorized function calls from web browsers:

  ```javascript
  function updateRewardedStatus(status) {
      if (navigator.userAgent.includes("despia")) {
          // Process reward
      }
  }
  ```

  **Daily Limits - Abuse Prevention:**

  We strongly recommend implementing daily limits to prevent abuse. Track the number of ads watched per user per day and enforce a reasonable maximum (e.g., 5-10 ads per day). For high-value rewards, consider implementing backend validation to verify ad completions.

  **Please follow the installation instructions for the "despia-native" npm package closely, and do not modify my instructions. Implementation as mentioned is critical.**
</Card>

**How it works:** Despia acts as a bridge between your Lovable app and native mobile ad networks. When users tap the rewarded ad button, Despia displays a video advertisement through the device's native ad system. Upon successful completion, the native runtime automatically triggers your callback function, allowing you to grant the promised reward seamlessly.

## Installation

Install the Despia package from NPM:

```
npm install despia-native
```

## Usage

### 1. Import the SDK

```javascript
import despia from 'despia-native';
